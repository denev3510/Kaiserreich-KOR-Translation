### Game Rules ###
RULE_GROUP_KAISERREICH_RULES코0=Game Rule Settings

RULE_WK2_BEGIN_OPTIONS코0=Early Second Weltkrieg
RULE_OPTION_RESTRICTED코0=Restricted
RULE_WK2_BEGIN_OPTIONS_RESTRICTED_DESC코0=Almost all paths which could lead to war breaking out between the Reichspakt and the Third Internationale before 1939 are blocked, even if this means early confrontations between the two always result in one party backing down.
RULE_OPTION_RARE코0=Rare
RULE_WK2_BEGIN_OPTIONS_RARE_DESC코0=Paths which could lead to war breaking out between the Reichspakt and the Third Internationale before 1939 aren't blocked, but the chances that they'll lead to war are very small.
RULE_OPTION_UNRESTRICTED코0=Unrestricted
RULE_WK2_BEGIN_OPTIONS_UNRESTRICTED_DESC코0=Any early confrontation between the Reichspakt and the Third Internationale could mean a breakout of the Second Weltkrieg, based on the chances involved in any event chain. This means early wars will happen frequently.

RULE_UNIT_LIMIT_OPTIONS코0=Division Limits
RULE_OPTION_STANDARD코0=Applies to All
RULE_UNIT_LIMIT_OPTIONS_STANDARD_DESC코0=Limits have been applied to how many divisions the AI can build, based on their factory counts and economy law level. Once the AI hits this limit, they will simply stop building new divisions. This limit also applies to a player, though for them it's a soft cap and they receive a malus based on how far over the limit they build.\n\n§RNote that this is a system put in place to reduce the inevitable slowdown that happens as a game goes on, as the sheer number of divisions in action is the primary cause of system lag.§!
RULE_OPTION_AI_ONLY코0=Applies to AI Only
RULE_UNIT_LIMIT_OPTIONS_AI_ONLY_DESC코0=Limits have been applied to how many divisions the AI can build, based on their factory counts and economy law level. Once the AI hits this limit, they will simply stop building new divisions. At this setting, there is no limit to how many divisions a player may build other than their ability to supply manpower and equipment.\n\n§RNote that this will put the player at a considerable advantage against AI countries that would otherwise be of comparable strengths.§!
RULE_OPTION_TURN_OFF코0=Turn Off
RULE_UNIT_LIMIT_OPTIONS_TURN_OFF_DESC코0=This turns off the division limit system completely.\n\n§RIt is suggested you only do this if you either don't mind game speeds getting much slower as the game goes on, or you have a VERY hefty computer to run the game.§!

RULE_DEMOB_OPTIONS코0=Peacetime Demobilization
RULE_OPTION_DEMOB_EXISTS코0=Default
RULE_OPTION_DEMOB_EXISTS_DESC코0=When at peace, the player will be prompted to reduce their economy and/or conscription laws to levels allowed in peacetime and according to their War Support within four months. The AI will do the same, though they will do so more quickly and will tend to reduce their laws to lower levels than the player is required to. If unit limits apply to the AI, this will also tend to prompt them to reduce the number of units they have active for performance reasons.
RULE_OPTION_DEMOB_AI_ONLY코0=Applies to AI Only
RULE_OPTION_DEMOB_AI_ONLY_DESC코0=In peacetime, the AI will reduce their economy and/or conscription laws. If unit limits apply to the AI, this will also prompt them to reduce the number of units they have active for performance reasons. The player, however, will never be prompted to reduce their laws.
RULE_OPTION_DEMOB_OFF코0=Turn Off
RULE_OPTION_DEMOB_OFF_DESC코0=Neither the player nor the AI will never be prompted to reduce their economy and/or conscription laws in peacetime.\n\n§RIt is suggested you only do this if you either don't mind game speeds getting much slower as the game goes on, or you have a VERY hefty computer to run the game.§!

RULE_FACTION_BUTTON_OPTIONS코0=Faction Diplomacy Buttons
RULE_OPTION_NO_BUTTON코0=Default
RULE_OPTION_NO_BUTTON_DESC코0=Creating factions, joining factions, and leaving factions have always been done in Kaiserreich via decisions, focuses, and events - so the presence of the diplomacy buttons was deemed unneeded, and thus they were removed from the list. By default, this game rule will keep them that way.
RULE_OPTION_BUTTON_PRESENT코0=Buttons Present
RULE_OPTION_BUTTON_PRESENT_DESC코0=This option restores the diplomacy buttons for creating, joining, and leaving factions.\n\n§RNote that this does not make them any more useable than they were previously - it simply restores them to the diplomacy interface. Any ability to use them above and beyond what Kaiserreich normally allows will need to come either via a sub-mod or through the console. Please use at your own risk - Kaiserreich's code does not assume that any country could potentially be in any faction, so using this function may mean encountering bugs that you otherwise would not. This option is primarily intended for those in multiplayer games, or those who otherwise know what they're doing and are willing to risk bugs in exchange for their own enjoyment of the mod.§!

Black Monday has put an end to such hopes, and has sounded the death-knell for an already ailing economy. Republicans and Democrats have both pledged to put thing but public confidence in the system is rapidly waning. Both Reed and Long have railed hard against the corrupt banking and political sectors, which they blame for the crash. To boot, 1936 is an election year, and elections have consequences.

Unable to make progress with both Jack Reed and Huey Long present, Garner orders the physical removal of Jack Reed and the SPA from the meeting. From then on, Garner subsequently compromises with Huey Long: in exchange for Long's support of the bill, amendments are made to benefit him. While the Emergency Austerity Measures bill passes in Congress with the endorsement of the AFP, SPA supporters across the Steel Belt are outraged by restrictions on industrial unions and socialist activities. Seizing this anger, Jack Reed declares the United States dead and takes up arms against the Federal Government. The United States descends into a civil war.

Long accuses Olson of being in league with Reed, and that the government has all but submitted the United States to syndicalism.
