### Leaders ###
# Mahidol Line
POLITICS_RAMA_VII_DESC코0=Prajadhipok, also known by his regnal name Rama VII, was enthroned as King of Siam upon the death of his brother in 1925. Unprepared for kingship, having previously been far down the order of succession, he is essentially a puppet of the Supreme Council of State run by his cousins. Educated abroad and commissioned in the British Army, Prajadhipok nonetheless genuinely cares for his people and works diligently to improve his subjects' lot." # Prajadhipok
POLITICS_RAMA_VIII_DESC코0=Ananda Mahidol, known by his regnal name Rama VIII, has ascended to the Siamese throne following the death of his uncle, Rama VII. Ananda Mahidol was once considered a very unlikely candidate for the throne, being barely a teenager and of low birth. He originally held the rank of 'Mom Chao', making him among the lowest of Siamese princes. Despite his youth and inexperience, he has quickly won the hearts of the Siamese people. Foreign observers, however, believe that he did not really want to be king that his reign would not last long. " # Ananda Mahidol
POLITICS_RAMA_VIX_DESC코0=Bhumibol Adulyadej, known by his regnal name Rama IX has ascended to the Siamese throne following the mysterious death of his late brother, Rama VIII. Bhumibol Adulyadej has so far proven himself much more politically competent than his late brother, navigating the convoluted Siamese political landscape with seeming ease. Many speak of Bhumibol Adulyadej as the saviour of the once embattled Siamese monarchy" # Bhumibol Adulyadej
# Paribatra Line
POLITICS_SUKHUMBHAND_DESC코0=Paribatra Sukhumbhand, cousin to expected successor to the Siamese throne Ananda Mahidol, has seized control of the Siamese government, citing Ananda's inexperience and his age. With the full support of the Privy Council, he has crowned himself as King Rama VIII, firmly establishing the Boripatr cadet branch as the new ruling house." # Paribatra Sukhumbhand
POLITICS_CHUMBHOTBONGS_PARIBATRA_DESC코0=Chumbhotbongs Paribatra, known by his regnal name Rama IX, has succeeded his father, Rama VIII, to the throne of Siam. Chumbhotbongs Paribatra is something of a recluse, but still politically competent. He is a known patron of the arts, having converted multiple state-owned properties into museums, and has personally sponsored many great artists both in Siam and abroad." # Chumbhotbongs Paribatra
POLITICS_SUKHUMABHININDA_DESC코0=Sukhumbhinanda, son of former King Paribatra Sukhumbhand (Rama VIII) and a lowborn woman, was legitimised by his brother King Rama IX due to the latter's inability to produce a male heir. He has ascended to the throne as Rama X. Sukhumbhinanda is a prominent philanthropist whose efforts to relieve Bangkok's poorest have garnered him much publicity. With Sukhumbhinanda's ascension much of the remaining public discontent with the monarchy has dissipated.
# Chrakrabongse Line
POLITICS_CHULA_CHAKRABONGSE_DESC코0=Chula Chakrabongse, the half-Ukrainian grandson of King Rama V, has been installed as king of Siam. Chula Chakrabongse lived an eccentric life of leisure in Britain and later Austria before becoming king and has delegated nearly all of his royal duties in favour of his passion for both horse and automobile racing.
# Left
POLITICS_SUPHA_SIRIMANON_DESC코0=Journalist, Poet, and now the new Premier of the Republic - Supha Sirimanon looked like an odd choice for the national leadership position at first. Within the leftist intelligentsia community though, he is more well-known under his pen name \"Jittin Thammachart\", and as the translator behind Das Kapital's Thai language publication.\n\nWhile an adherent of Classical Marxism at heart, Supha is a Pragmatist and viewed Planned Economy as the way forward - and that there's no way for the Workers and Capitalists to reconcile with each other.
POLITICS_PRIDI_PANOMYONG_DESC코0=Pridi Phanomyong, also known by his ministerial title 'Luang Praditmanutham', immediately set out to better the lives of the Siamese people upon his appointment as a minister. His controversial 'Yellow Cover Dossier' outlined his political and economic reform agenda and divided the Siamese government, but the controversy only served to further Pridi's political career." # Pridi Phanomyong at the onset of the CW
POLITICS_PRIDI_PANOMYONG_REBEL_WIN_DESC코0=Pridi Phanmoyong, previously known by his ministerial title 'Luang Praditmanutham', has become the Chairman of the Sapha Prachachon following a brief but bloody Siamese Civil War. Phanomyong's policies of economic nationalisation and radical parliamentarian reform may now continue, however challenges from more radical elements within Pridi's Sahachip Party have grown significantly. Despite his popularity, Phanomyong struggles to maintain his authority even with his allies in the Navy." # Pridi Phanomyong after winning his rebellion
# Right
POLITICS_PLAEK_KHITTASANGKHA_DESC코0=Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram, more popularly known as 'Chormpon Por' by the locals and 'Phibun' in the West, the one-time ally of Pridi Phanmoyong and the People's Party has seized power following the Yellow Cover Dossier Affair. Together with Luang Wichitwathakarn and his allies in the military he has built his own cult of personality to side-line the Monarchy. He views the current state of Siam as an 'outdated relic of a bygone era' and intends to use his power to promote militarism and nationalism, proclaiming both to be additional essential principles of the modern nation." # Plaek Phibunsongkhram after Coup d'état
POLITICS_PHAO_SRIYANOND_DESC코0=Police Chief Phao Sriyanond has succeeded Plaek Phibunsongkhram as leader of Siam's military regime with the support of the Soi Ratchakhru Clique. Phao is known for his brutality and political cunning, and his political opponents tend to 'disappear'. Phao also believes the Siamese monarchy to be an antiquated relic which impairs the cause of nationalism, and is thus an avowed Republican" # Phao Sriyanond
POLITICS_SARIT_THANARAT_DESC코0=General Sarit Thanarat has succeeded Plaek Phibunsongkhram as leader of Siam's military regime with the support of the Sisao Thawaet Clique. Originally a lowly officer in the Phayap Army, he quickly rose through the ranks with Plaek and Phin's help. An ardent anti-Syndicalist, he views the Monarchy as an important tool against the reds and as the focal point of Thai Nationalism." # Sarit Thanarat
# Republic
POLITICS_THAWAN_THAMRONGNAWASAWAT_DESC코0=Nicknamed the 'Golden-Tongue Statesman', Thawan is renowned for his public speaking and debating skills, which he fully exploits for his coalition building. As a champion of the grassroots, the ex-Admiral favours policies which helps the common people, such as price ceiling for household commodities and expansion of public welfare. However, these policies also put him at odds with the capitalists and the burgeoning Thai-Chinese middle class who are burdened with greater taxes.
POLITICS_POTE_SARASIN_DESC코0=A Thai-Chinese from upper middle-class background, Pote Sarasin's experience in the Ministry of Finance during the Black Monday has shaped his worldview. As fan of the Austrian economist Hayek and a strict adherence to the law, he is against the expansion of state-owned enterprises while trying to ensure the fair, free and open competition. Another policy of his being the expansion of higher education across the nation as a mean to reinvigorate the recovering local industries.
POLITICS_SENI_PRAMOJ_DESC코0=As a member of a cadet branch of the Chakri Dynasty with Chinese ancestry, Seni may appears as an odd choice of leader for republican Siamese state. Despite that, this 'Young Viper' manages to gather enough political clout among the many conservative circles with his own political shrewdness rather than his familial connection to gain a working majority for the new government to function properly. His policy of 'Ngoen Phan' (Money Fluctuation) help keeps the rural area happy and secured from the Syndicalist hands. Whether if he only pays lip services to the republican causes, however, remain to be seen...

### Leader Traits ###
SIA_iron_marshal_trait코0=The Iron Field Marshal\n§gBeing known for his charismatic and cunning leadership since his interwar years in Burma, it is no surprise that Phibun would eventually land himself on top of the pecking order. His obsession for total control of the state affairs and his attitude of side-lining the monarchy earned him another nickname - \"Siamese Cao Cao/Caesar\".§!
SIA_pho_khun_trait코0=The Paternal Despot\n§gInspired by Sukhothai's era notion of Pho Khun (Patriarchal rule) and Ayuthaya's despotic rulership, Sarit felt such ruling style fits his political taste the best. He viewed himself as the foremost leader to guide the country through its \"Patiwat\" (revolutionary) phase against the rising leftist tides.§!
SIA_prancing_knight_trait코0=The Prancing Knight\n§gOne simply does not rise to the top position without deceit and deception - Phao lacks neither and is ready to smack down any opposition utilizing both trickery and his own heavily militarized police forces in tow.§!

## PREEXISTING EVENTS (ID 0-999)

#################################

## Introduction Events ##
siam.1.t코0=The Kingdom of [SIA.GetSIAshortname] in 1936
siam.1.d코0=One of the countries that benefited from German victory during the Weltkrieg, [SIA.GetSIAshortname] regained most of its former land which had previously been lost to the western imperialists. While [SIA.GetSIAshortname]'s relationship with the Huns is, in general, cordial, the fact that they thwarted her expansionist ambitions during the 1929 Intervention in Burma has strained diplomatic and military ties between the two. If [SIA.GetSIAshortname] should reconcile with the Germans or align itself with others power is a matter to be decided in the coming decade.
siam.1.a코0=Interesting, tell me more!
siam.1.b코0=I've a good grasp of the general situation.

siam.2.t코0=The State of Politics
siam.2.d코0=Ever since the coronation of King Rama VII in 1925 most, if not all, of the policies set forth within [SIA.GetSIAshortname] have been dictated by the Aphiratthamontri Sapha (Supreme Council of State). This is a council made up of the King's older siblings, who have continually worked to consolidate their power while keeping the power of the king over the nation weakened. Despite promising the [SIA.GetProperAdjective] intelligentsia that a codified constitution would be issued any reform has been tough to pass, as it would be against the interests of the nobility.\n\nSurrounded by enemies, such as the Konbaung dynasty to the west, Yunnanese bandits to the north, and the German imperialists to the east, [SIA.GetSIAshortname] is in a dire situation. It will either perish, forever confined to the pages of a history book, or shall reform itself and emerge a modern state, be it by negotiation or by force.
siam.2.a코0=I pity the poor king...

siam.3.t코0=The Kingdom's Many Other Problems
siam.3.d코0=While seemingly economically and industrially prosperous to outside eyes, [SIA.GetSIAshortname] is actually very reliant on investments made by Germany and must cherish the economic ties it shares with the nation. Industry is a very fragile and small section of the economy, which is mainly built around rice, sugar, and timber exports. Nationalism among ethnic minorities has been rising, which raises the spectre of separatist movements in the near future. Moreover: the bloated bureaucratic system, which has been present since the reign of Rama VI, has siphoned off much needed taxes and thus allowed for bandits to continually run wild in the fringes of [SIA.GetSIAshortname].
siam.3.a코0=I'd rather pick the Philippines.

## Black Monday and Early political chaos # Max Reform 7 - Lowest 0: 0-2 = Khana Ratsadon coup, 3-4 = Civil War with Prajadhipok Bias (based on Boworadet Rebellion), 5-6 = success, 7 = Reactionary coup with Paribatra as HoS
siam.4.t코0=Black Monday hits [SIA.GetSIAshortname]!
siam.4.d코0=Due to its heavy reliance on its economic ties with Germany Black Monday has quickly dragged [SIA.GetSIAshortname] into an economic abyss as demand for her main agricultural exports has fallen sharply and shipments have been left to wither in their warehouses. Clerks working for foreign companies are continually being laid off, while the people have begun to gather around the Grand Palace looking for hope. It is apparent that we must do something about our economic situation lest it worsen and send us spiralling further down.
siam.4.a코0=Khun Prah!

siam.5.t코0=Jasmine Rice Problems
siam.5.d코0=One of the largest exporters of rice within [SIA.GetSIAshortname], the farmers across the Chao Phraya, have asked for government intervention to deal with the excessive supply of rice due to a general fall in demand and fewer export opportunities after Black Monday.
siam.5.a코0=Purchase most of the rice to help stabilise the price." #-200, +2 reform
siam.5.b코0=Agree to buy up some excess rice." #-100, +1 reform
siam.5.c코0=The free market shall resolve the issue!" #0, 0 reform

siam.6.t코0=Bloated Bureaucracy
siam.6.d코0=The modern bureaucratic system was formed during the reign of Rama V and had been greatly expanded by Rama VI. However, it has proved to be too large to effectively serve the state. Firing more people, however, would mean an increase in the unemployment rate at exactly the time when we want it to drop.
siam.6.a코0=Lay off a few of our clerks." # 0 reform
siam.6.b코0=Lay off managers and ministers." #-100, +1 reform
siam.6.c코0=Allow the status-quo for now." #-200, +2 reform

siam.7.t코0=Military Expenditure
siam.7.d코0=[SIA.GetSIAshortname] currently spends up to 25% of her annual revenue on the preservation and maintenance of the military-industrial complex, as she is surrounded by both historical enemies and imperialistic westerners who desire her land. However perhaps slightly cutting our military expenditures wouldn't hurt us too much?
siam.7.a코0=Cut any and all research funding." #-10 for 3 years, 0 reform
siam.7.b코0=Cut everything bar the development of new rifles." #-10 for 3 years, +1 reform
siam.7.c코0=We shouldn't show any weaknesses!" #-200, +2 reform

siam.8.t코0=Emergency Tax
siam.8.d코0=Even though we've enacted many sweeping reforms we still do not have enough money to sufficiently balance this year's budget. An emergency tax should help remedy this situation but will create more suffering for our loyal subjects.
siam.8.a코0=Increase the income tax rate!" #+50, 0 reform
siam.8.b코0=Double the inheritance tax!" #+10, +1 reform
siam.8.c코0=Lift the ban on gambling." #+30, -5 NP, +1 reform

## New Governmnet Established for Siam ##
siam.10.t코0=The Khana Ratsadon's Provisional Cabinet
siam.10.d코0=Following the bloodless revolution we must rebuild the nation from the ground up. Luang Praditmanutham, head of the civilian faction of the provisional government and a prominent leftist, is now working on the creation of a formal constitution while others are beginning to educate the masses about the merits and workings of parliamentary democracy. Alongside all of this Phraya Phahonponpayuhasena has readied his troops, in case of an opportunistic invasion by foreign powers.
siam.10.a코0=This is a great leap forward for [SIA.GetSIAshortname]!

siam.11.t코0=The Khanagummakarn Ratsadon's Provisional Cabinet
siam.11.d코0=Following the ratification of the constitution the People's Committee, a group chosen by Prajadhipok himself, has begun the education of the masses in the ways of proper parliamentary democracy.\n\nHeaded by the [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Court, the Committee is also responsible for educational, health, and industrialisation reforms. The path ahead for [SIA.GetSIAshortname] will hardly be a stroll in the park but a bright future does await our great nation.
siam.11.a코0=This a great leap forward for the [SIA.GetProperAdjective] people!

## Khana Ratsadon 1936 Election and subsequent Civil War ##

siam.12.t코0=The "Yellow Cover Dossier" Affair
siam.12.d코0=Today Luang Praditmanutham, Minister of State and a member of the People's Party, presented the draft of his "National Economic Development Plan" proposal to the National Assembly.\n\nKnown as the "Yellow Cover Dossier" the plan details the formation of a welfare state, redistribution of land, state intervention in the private sector, and a system of subsidies for farmers.\n\nSome have compared the proposal to that of a syndicalist while others have agreed that the reforms will greatly improve the lives of the [SIA.GetProperAdjective] people.\n\nAll that remains is to see what his majesty has to say...
siam.12.a코0=His Majesty agrees with Praditmanutham.
siam.12.b코0=His Majesty supports a watered down proposal.
siam.12.c코0=His Majesty demands the arrest of the syndicalist sympathiser!

siam.13.t코0=Prajadhipok's Reply
siam.13.d코0=King Prajadhipok's reply has arrived and is heavily critical of Luang Praditmanutham's draft, going so far as to accuse Praditmanutham of being a syndicalist! An emergency session of the chief members of the People's Party has led to the party deciding to...
siam.13.a코0=... back down for the moment.
siam.13.b코0=... file a lawsuit against the King.

siam.14.t코0=Domestic Tensions
siam.14.d코0=Thawan Ritthidet, a private citizen, has recently filed a lawsuit against the King; accusing him of intervention in political, state, and economic affairs. The fallout over Luang Praditmanutham's plan has further divided the cabinet and has pitted the Royalists and the Parliamentarians against each other.
siam.14.a코0=Reconciliation is in order, it seems.
siam.14.b코0=Arrest those Syndicalists!

siam.15.t코0=Plaek Phibunsongkhram's Dilemma
siam.15.d코0=A political crisis is currently ongoing and has nearly reached the boiling point! Tensions are high and we must take steps to remedy the situation. What shall we do?
siam.15.a코0=It's treason then! (Side with the Parliamentarians)
siam.15.b코0=HM's dignity must be upheld! (Side with the Royalists)
siam.15.c코0=Try to end this factional bickering.

siam.16.t코0=Dawn of the Siamese Civil War
siam.16.prd코0=Despite the chief of the armed forces declaring his allegiance to the monarchy, a small mutiny in Sattahip and Morlumlerng by the navy has quickly grown out of control and has now engulfed the entire nation in chaos.
siam.16.ppd코0=Despite the chief of the armed forces declaring his allegiance to the new cabinet, a small mutiny in Lopburi and Nakhon Ratchasima by the army has quickly grown out of control and has now engulfed the entire nation in chaos.
siam.16.pra코0=For the country! (Rebel side)
siam.16.prb코0=For the king! (Government side)
siam.16.ppa코0=For the country! (Government side)
siam.16.ppb코0=For the king! (Rebel side)

siam.17.t코0=Rebels controlling Bangkok (AI event)
siam.17.d코0=This event isn't meant to fire for Human players - please report this as a bug if this appears to you
siam.17.a코0=Surrender (to Royalists)
siam.17.b코0=Surrender (to Parliamentarians)

siam.18.t코0=The Reclamation of Bangkok
siam.18.d코0=The Siamese Civil War has recently taken an unexpected turn for the better, as our side has managed to reclaim Bangkok. This is a shattering blow to the opposition and thus, while some ministers in the illegitimate government have fled abroad, most have complied with our demands and have promptly laid down their arms.
siam.18.a코0=The Royalists have reclaimed power!
siam.18.b코0=Syndicalism shall guide our nation!

siam.20.t코0=Parliamentarians Rebels Surrender (AI side)
siam.20.d코0=This event isn't meant to fire for Human players - please report this as a bug if this appears to you
siam.20.a코0=They surrendered (Royalist)

siam.21.t코0=Royalist Rebels Surrender (AI side)
siam.21.d코0=This event isn't meant to fire for Human players - please report this as a bug if this appears to you
siam.21.a코0=They surrendered (Parliamentarians)

siam.22.t코0=Plaek Phibunsongkhram's Coup D'état
siam.22.d코0=As time has passed and people have adjusted to the seizure of power, the situation in [SIA.GetSIAshortname] has finally begun to stabilise. It is finally time to...
siam.22.a코0=... repeal martial law.
siam.22.b코0=... take power for ourselves.

siam.23.t코0=[GetYear] General Election" #1936
siam.23.d.syn코0=Following the purge of the conservatives from all chambers of the government and the dismantling of the power of nobility, the results of the election are pretty clear.
siam.23.d.con코0=Following the purge of the socialists from all chambers of the government, in addition to the banning of their organisations, the results of the election are pretty clear.
siam.23.d.norm코0=The predictions made in the polls with regards to this election have been very close. However, it seems as though one side has managed to eke out a majority in parliament.
siam.23.a코0=The liberals have emerged victorious!
siam.23.b코0=The socialists have emerged victorious!
siam.23.c코0=The conservatives have emerged victorious!

siam.24.t코0=End of the [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Civil War" # Government
siam.24.prd코0=After the reclamation of our eastern and southern regions by government forces the remaining revolutionaries have decided to flee to Saigon, where we must contend with extradition procedures. It is more important to first mourn the losses sustained during the war by our loyal subjects. A countrywide public funeral has been held, with the remains of our loyal subjects carried through [GetSIAprefixTH]damnoen road to Sanam Luang where King Prajadhipok has given us permission to set up a public funeral pyre on the sacred royal cremation ground.
siam.24.ppd코0=After subduing most of the separatists and rebels we have received word that the remaining rebels have fled to Yunnan. No matter, for we shall catch what remains of the rebel scum later. We must first mourn the losses sustained by our loyal men, to that end the royal cremation ground has been converted into a public pyre. Prajadhipok, who was largely unrelated to the rebellion, has been permitted to return to the Grand Palace.
siam.24.a코0=Long live the King!" # Plaek Royalist
siam.24.b코0=Long live may our Democracy be!" # Plaek Parliamentarians

siam.25.t코0=End of the [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Civil War" # Rebel
siam.25.prd코0=After the reclamation of our eastern and southern regions by government forces the remaining revolutionaries have decided to flee to Saigon, where we must contend with extradition procedures. It is more important to first mourn the losses sustained during the war by our loyal subjects. A countrywide public funeral has been held, with the remains of our loyal subjects carried through [GetSIAprefixTH]damnoen road to Sanam Luang where King Prajadhipok has given us permission to set up a public funeral pyre on the sacred royal cremation ground.
siam.25.ppd코0=After subduing most of the rebels we have received word that the remaining royalists have fled to Yunnan with the king. No matter, for we shall catch what remains of the loyalist scum later. We must first mourn the losses sustained by our loyal men, to that end the royal cremation ground has been converted into a public pyre.
siam.25.b코0=Long live the King!" # Plaek Royalist
siam.25.a코0=Chaiyo for the Republic!" # Plaek Parliamentarians; Chaiyo = Hurrah in Thai

## Industrial Nationalizaion ##

siam.26.t코0=The Question of German-Owned Factories
siam.26.d코0=Prominent German businesses within the [SIA.GetName] are mostly linked to the shipping, logging and railway industries. A large loan on good terms from the government might easily convince them to kick-start their operations again, though we could simply seize their factories as well. Doing so, however, could mean economic suicide for the [SIA.GetName]. How should we approach the situation?
siam.26.a코0=Seize the means of production!.
siam.26.b코0=Offer monetary compensation.
siam.26.c코0=Let's look elsewhere...

siam.27.t코0=[SIA.GetSIAshortname] Seizes Our Factories!
siam.27.d.bast코0=The new [SIA.GetProperAdjective] government has begun their 'Industrial Nationalization' programme in order to help strengthen their economy. Our factories in the [SIA.GetName] have been wrongfully seized by the military junta of Premier Plaek Phibunsongkhram.
siam.27.d.comp코0=The new [SIA.GetProperAdjective] government has begun their 'Industrial Nationalization' programme in order to help strengthen their economy. Our factories in the [SIA.GetName] have been wrongfully seized by the military junta of Premier Plaek Phibunsongkhram. He has, however, offered us monetary compensation for our losses.
siam.27.a코0=Those bastards!
siam.27.b코0=At least they've given us compensation.

siam.28.t코0=The Question of American-Owned Factories
siam.28.d코0=The American car company, Ford, have their South-East Asian operations based here in Ayutthaya. Due to political and economic strife in the States it is unlikely that the United States would retaliate if we were to seize the factory. What shall we do?

siam.29.t코0=The Question of Canadian-Owned Rubber Plantations
siam.29.d코0=With the British in South-East Asia forced to retreat to Australasia following the British Revolution, many private rubber plantations in Sirat Malai have been left deserted for some time by their former owners. While we could simply seize the plantations, doing so would upset the Australasians who are a major naval power in the Asia-Pacific region and, potentially, allies. What shall we do?

siam.30.t코0=The Question of Japanese-Owned Iron Mines
siam.30.d코0=The Japanese own a few iron mines in Yala and Nakhon Si Thammarat which are used to transfer key raw materials to their home islands. While we could potentially seize the mines doing so would alienate us and permanently damage [SIA.GetProperAdjective]-Japanese relations, leaving us without a powerful ally to help challenge the German hegemony in the region. What shall we do?

siam.31.t코0=Phibunsongkhram Criticised For Weak Foreign Policy
siam.31.d코0=Due to the National Industrialisation Scheme bringing about little to no economic change our opponents in the media and political arena alike have accused us of weak and ineffective leadership.
siam.31.a코0=Damn it!

## Siamese- Burmese War (NatPop) ##

siam.32.t코0=Burmese Agitators Captured
siam.32.d코0=Eleven Burmese agitators in Morlumlerng, one of the Mon majority cities near the Salween River delta, were caught today spreading pamphlets which bore the slogan 'Liberation From The [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Yoke'. Perhaps we can take advantage of this event to help rally support for our regime and finish off the Burmese threat once and for all!
siam.32.a코0=Who said we were cowards?
siam.32.b코0=A chance to show them who's boss!
siam.32.c코0=We aren't ready for that right now...

siam.33.t코0=[SIA.GetNameDefCap] Has Declared War!
siam.33.d코0=Bad news! Apparently the [SIA.GetProperAdjective] have caught eleven "Burmese spies", despite them being in what is rightfully our territory. Their army is now advancing towards Yangon. This is outrageous!
siam.33.a코0=To arms, citizens!

siam.34.t코0=Treaty of Thawai" # Siamese Wins
siam.34.d코0=The decadent Burmese in Yangon have been routed and our forces are securely entrenched in the smouldering remains of their capital. Now is the best time to demand concessions from the Burmese government, victory is ours. The question is: should we seek peace or continue fighting the war until we've rid ourselves of the Burmese forever?
siam.34.a코0=We'll demand Upper Shan and reunite the Thais.
siam.34.b코0=No peace with the Burmese, total conquest!

siam.35.t코0=Demands of the [SIA.GetProperAdjective]
siam.35.d코0=The [SIA.GetProperAdjective] dogs have completely overpowered us and we are humiliated. Now they've demanded we surrender the Upper Shan states. Although these are harsh terms it might be wise to comply, lest our rivals in the region act upon our weakened situation.
siam.35.a코0=We have no other choice...
siam.35.b코0=They must be joking, Kaba Ma Kyei!

siam.36.t코0=The Burmese Government Refuses!
siam.36.d코0=The foolish Burmese have refused our generous offer.
siam.36.a코0=The war must continue, it seems...

siam.37.t코0=Treaty of Thawai" # Burmese Wins
siam.37.d코0=The decadent [SIA.GetProperAdjective] in Bangkok have been routed and our forces are securely entrenched in the smouldering remains of Chiang Mai. Now is the best time to demand concessions from the [SIA.GetProperAdjective] government, victory is ours. The question is: should we seek peace or continue fighting the war until we've rid ourselves of the [SIA.GetProperAdjective]?
siam.37.a코0=We shall take back our rightful territory.
siam.37.b코0=No peace with the [SIA.GetProperAdjective], total conquest!

siam.38.t코0=Demands of the Burmese
siam.38.d코0=The Burmese dogs have completely overpowered us and we are humiliated. Now they've demanded we surrender the Lower Shan and Morlumlerng states. Although these are harsh terms it might be wise to comply, lest our rivals in the region act upon our weakened situation.
siam.38.a코0=We have no other choice...
siam.38.b코0=They must be joking, Rao Suu Mai Thoi!

siam.39.t코0=The [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Government Refuses!
siam.39.d코0=The foolish [SIA.GetProperAdjective] have refused our rightful claims.
siam.39.a코0=The war must continue, it seems...

## Phibunsongkhram's Ratthaniyom Reform, Assassination attempt and its aftermath ##
siam.40.t코0=Implementing The Ratthaniyom Reforms
siam.40.d코0=The Ratthaniyom, or "Popular State", reforms were proposed by the nationalists as a means to reach the ultimate goal of a strong nation which favour of the Thai people. However, this may result in some unwanted friction with the Malays, Chinese, Mons, and Cambodians living within our nation.
siam.40.a코0=Who cares? Implement the reforms.
siam.40.b코0=On the second thought, this is probably a bad idea.

siam.41.t코0=Changing Siam's Name?
siam.41.d코0=While our country has been known as Siam since the late Ayutthaya era, intelligence within the [SIA.GetProperAdjective] community have pointed out that, since our nation is mostly made up by Thais, it would make sense to change our name to Pratet Thai, or Thailand, in order to reflect that fact. However, the could antagonise the minorities in our nation. What shall we do?
siam.41.a코0=We shall be a nation of the Thai people!
siam.41.b코0=We shall remain as Siam!

siam.42.t코0=The Tai Merger and New National Anthem Act
siam.42.d코0=Following the passage of the law which has officially made us Thailand, the use of use of Tai Lao, Tai Dam, Tai Daeng, Tai Puan, Tai Yai, Tai Sayam, Tai Khuean, Tai Lue, Tai Yuan and others in the Tai Kadai cultural group are now simply known as Thais. Minorities will retain the Thai prefix as they are, as mandated by law, also Thais. The national anthem shall also be changed to reflect this new reality, with a competition set to occur in thirty days to help decide the new anthem.
siam.42.a코0=Pass it!
siam.42.b코0=Rather not.

siam.43.t코0=[GetYear] National Language and Compulsory Education Act
siam.43.d코0=To further our policy of Thaification, or the integration of the minorities into Thailand, the central Thai dialect (the Bangkokian dialect) has now been designated the primary language, with northern Thai and Laotian dialects banned. The new law shall make the teaching of the central Thai dialect compulsory and will negatively affect ethnic and religious schools, such as Chinese-run schools, Catholic Assumption Colleges and Pornor Muslim Schools in the south, unless they agree to comply with the new law. Of course, we could also be less forceful in our implementation of the law or cancel the passage of it entirely.
siam.43.a코0=Thaification is the way forward!
siam.43.b코0=Let us simply promote the use of the Bangkokian dialect.
siam.43.c코0=Cancel the passage of the law...

siam.44.t코0=Foreigner Workforce Exclusion Act
siam.44.d코0=Due to the recent influx of Chinese immigrants–who had escaped the carnage and destruction of the Chinese Civil War–into [SIA.GetName], we have seen an increase in the unemployment rate. To tackle this problem, the government has decided to declare select jobs as off-limits to unskilled immigrants and set them aside for our own people. This will, however, have negatively impact on our economy due to our reliance on Chinese labour.
siam.44.a코0=We must preserve the [SIA.GetProperAdjective] market!
siam.44.b코0=We need the foreign labour; cancel the act!

siam.45.t코0=Completion of the Ratthaniyom Reforms

SIA_khana_ratsadon_desc코0="... The King governs without principle. The country is left to the mercy of fate, as demonstrated by the current depression and hardship... The People's Party has no wish to snatch the throne, hence it invites the King to retain the position. But he must adopt a constitution to legitimately govern the country..."\n- excerpt from the Khana Ratsadon Manifesto
SIA_iron_marshal코0=The Iron Field Marshal
SIA_iron_marshal_desc코0=Plaek Phibunsongkhram, previously titled 'Luang Phibunsongkhram', whom of which gained fame during the [SIA.GetProperAdjective] intervention in Burma, now faces the monumental task of keeping the nation together and safe from the dissident threat.
SIA_yuwachontaharn코0=Yuwachon Taharn
SIA_yuwachontaharn_desc코0=The Yuwachon Taharn (Youth Militia) is a reserve officer cadet training programme, which aims to better the combat performance of new recruits. By ensuring that every able-bodied man understands how to properly wield and use a rifle we can increase the quality of our army.
SIA_nationalizationofforeignindustries코0=Nationalisation of Foreign Industries
SIA_nationalizationofforeignindustries_desc코0=[SIA.GetSIAshortname] will need everything she can get in order to stand up on her own in this ever-turbulent world. We will either purchase all foreign factories within our nation or, if left with no other choice, seize them by force. These factories shall be nationalised and used to help further our industrialisation programme.
SIA_ratthaniyomdecrees코0=The Ratthaniyom Decrees
SIA_ratthaniyomdecrees_desc코0=Thaification policies have already begun to take effect. Thai script is now standardised for usage; Betel chewing has been banned; the central Thai language is being enforced in schools nationwide and Chinese/Muslim schools who have not been compliant with our demands have been shut down. In addition, the new national anthem is being promoted to further the new Thai identity.
SIA_reapporachthemonarchy코0=Reapproach the Monarchy
SIA_reapporachthemonarchy_desc코0=Following the assassination of Plaek Phibunsongkhram, Sarit Thanarat has managed to take control over both the armed forces and the government in quick succession. To move towards his ideal of Patiwat (revolution) and institute the guiding principle of "Phokhun". Thanarat views reconciliation with the Chakri dynasty as essential, as the monarchy must serve the role of moral guidance.
SIA_buddhisttraditions코0=Buddhist Traditions
SIA_buddhisttraditions_desc코0=The promotion Theravada Buddhism as the national religion, to further national unity, shall begin with the establishment of a single Supreme Patriarch for both the Mahanikai and Thammayutthanikai sects; alongside the minority of Mahayana Buddhists within the nation. This will, however, dissatisfy the Muslims who reside in the south.
SIA_creationoftherepublic코0=Creation of the Republic
SIA_creationoftherepublic_desc코0=Following the assassination of Plaek Phibunsongkhram, Phao Sriyanond has managed to take control over both the armed forces and the government in quick succession. Viewing the monarchy as an archaic relic and disliking the status of the monarchy during Phibunsongkhram's tenure, Sriyanond believes that the old system should be discarded in favour of a republic.
SIA_survivorofthecivilwar코0=Lessons of the Civil War
SIA_survivorofthecivilwar_desc코0=The toll taken on [SIA.GetSIAshortname] from the civil war has surpassed even the Burmese invasion of Ayutthaya in 1765, it is clear that we must learn from this mess if we are to further ourselves as a nation.
SIA_prestigious_senate코0=The Prestigious Senate
SIA_prestigious_senate_desc코0=The Wutthisapha (Senate), which bears a close resemblance to the British House of Lords, has been introduced with the intention of allowing the King to appoint loyal and experienced advisers. This will also allow him to halt the passage of some of the more radical bills proposed by elements within the government.
SIA_privycouncilreforms코0=Privy Council Reforms
SIA_privycouncilreforms_desc코0=With the Supreme Council of State possessing the ability to dictate the King's policies from behind-the-scenes, perhaps we should look into reforming the old Privy Council? This would allow us to bring in like-minded figures to jockey for influence against the nobility, potentially dethroning them as the true power in our nation.
SIA_empowerthenobility코0=Empower the Nobility
SIA_empowerthenobility_desc코0=By modernising the outdated nobility system into one that is based off of the ideals of meritocracy, as opposed to simply abolishing it, we may be able to achieve our dream of bringing about a more efficient bureaucratic system.
SIA_fathergovernschildren코0=Father Governs Children
SIA_fathergovernschildren_desc코0=We will harken back to the Sukothai era, the reign of the benevolent King Ramkamhaeng the Great, by allowing our subjects to voice their issues directly to the Privy Council. This will have the added bonus of assisting with the resolution of several issues in a much more efficient manner.
SIA_reconstruction코0=Rise from the Ashes
SIA_reconstruction_desc코0=We must undertake a broad and sweeping construction programme, to restore not only the nation itself but the spirit of our people as well. We will honour the sacrifices made by our allies and all of those who had rallied behind us during our darkest hour.
SIA_amnesty코0=Issuing Amnesties
SIA_amnesty_desc코0=From the brutality of the civil war we have seen that we need to unify the people to guide the nation through this period of calamity. Therefore, we have decided to grant amnesty to the officers who fought against us. While this may result in some unrest these traitorous officers continue to remain important to us, thus their assistance is necessary.
SIA_the_great_purge코0=Military Purges
SIA_the_great_purge_desc코0=The turbulent upheavals of the civil war have taught us that traitors are behind every corner and must be rooted out, thus we shall rid ourselves of all of the officers who fought against us. While this will negatively affect our operational capacity, their deaths will allow us to consolidate power in the long run.
SIA_military_royalty코0=Ensuring Loyalty
SIA_military_royalty_desc코0=In order to avoid the possibility of a rebellious military we must ensure that the surviving armed forces are loyal to both the government and the people, not subversive outsiders and revolutionaries.
SIA_people_assembly코0=The People's Assembly
SIA_people_assembly_desc코0=How can it be that in the twentieth century ours remains a feudal nation? Inspired by the heroic revolutionaries of France, past and present, we shall establish a new government that will root out the aristocracy for the proletariat and peasants.
SIA_faith_in_the_star코0=Our Faith in the Star
SIA_faith_in_the_star_desc코0=To ensure that our revolution truly bears fruit we must spread our doctrine to the masses and bring them the hope and assurance of a brighter future ahead. The red star must shine bright and help guide them through these gloomy times.

SIA_new_order_rise_desc코0=The Krating Daeng (Red Gaurs) Paramilitary Group has been created by the government, to root out the remaining opposition of capitalists and nobles. Once we are rid of them, we can surely transition to more peaceful ways.
SIA_arunothai코0=Arunothai
SIA_arunothai_desc코0=In order to ensure the protection of the new system we must sacrifice everything within our power, we can promise the people nothing but blood, toil, tears, and sweat. The red dawn shall ensure both warmth and unity, destroying any capitalists who dare try and destabilise our glorious nation!

### Government Reform Path ###
SIA_governmentalreform코0=Governmental Reform
SIA_governmentalreform_desc코0=As it stands the current bureaucratic system is oversized, especially considering the size of [SIA.GetSIAshortname]. Not only does this make it inefficient but it also continues to drain a larger portion of our budget as the years pass. Undertaking reformation should be a top priority.
SIA_juridicialreform코0=Judicial Reform
SIA_juridicialreform_desc코0=While the archaic Ayutthayan era laws are no longer in place we must regain the jurisdiction rights we lost after the ratification of the Bowring Treaty to boost our prestige worldwide. By doing so, we will make our judicial system much more effective.
SIA_centralizedpolicecommand코0=Centralised Police Command
SIA_centralizedpolicecommand_desc코0=Following the Weltkrieg our police command has become paralysed as it is comprised of a mix of German, Italian, and American employees. By slowly replacing them with [SIA.GetProperAdjective] graduates, and merging the metropolitan and regional police command, we can ensure greater efficiency from our police force.
SIA_SDSI코0=[SIA.GetSIAintAgencyName]
SIA_SDSI_desc코0=The '[SIA.GetSIAshortname] Department of Secret Intelligence' (also known as the Samnak Khaokrong Haeng Chart) shall ensure the maintenance of stability throughout the nation by handling and keeping track of both domestic and foreign intelligence.
SIA_nationalcurriculumact코0=National Curriculum Act
SIA_nationalcurriculumact_desc코0=While Rama V and Rama VI enacted laws in favour of bringing education to [SIA.GetSIAshortname], we should begin to focus on the quality of this education. Primary education shall now be lengthened to six years while education shall be made compulsory until Grade 12. Harmful material, such as syndicalist or separatist propaganda, shall also be heavily monitored.
SIA_regionaluniversities코0=Creation of Regional Universities
SIA_regionaluniversities_desc코0=In order to support our nation we must first create a strong educational foundation. Through the creation of regional universities, in Chiang Mai, Khonkaen, and Hat Yai (Songkhla), higher education will be made more affordable for people who live far away from Bangkok.
SIA_kingmongkutinstitute코0=King Mongkut's Institute of Technology
SIA_kingmongkutinstitute_desc코0=Named after a [SIA.GetProperAdjective] king, who was known for his monumental scientific feats, this specialised research facility shall vastly increase our research capability while also harnessing the top minds [SIA.GetSIAshortname] has to offer.

### Economic Path ###
SIA_intialeconomictsabilisation코0=Initial Economic Stabilisation

SIA_bailoutsiamcement_desc코0=By providing bailouts to [SIA.GetSIAcementcorp], the largest cement and building material company in [SIA.GetName], we can ensure that the company stays afloat and avoid any further negative impacts on our economy.
SIA_chiangmaioil코0=Chiang Mai Oil Discovery
SIA_chiangmaioil_desc코0=Crude oil was first discovered in the Fang district, specifically Chiang Mai, in 1921 but was never properly exploited. The current economic crisis has driven up the price to record levels and any instability in the region might cut us off from our imported sources in Palembang. Becoming more self-reliant may well help improve our struggling industrialisation as well.
SIA_thaioilcorp코0=[SIA.GetProperAdjective] Oil Corporation
SIA_thaioilcorp_desc코0=By investing in the foundation of a central oil company we can ensure that the oil within our nation is better managed and can more effectively prospect and drill wells.
SIA_rayonrefineries코0=Rayong Refineries
SIA_rayonrefineries_desc코0=Formerly the 'Department of Fuel Acquisition' in the Ministry of Defence, a newly created state-owned enterprise will ensure that the oil within our nation is better managed and that we can more effectively refine what we drill.
SIA_newconstructionmethod코0=New Construction Methods
SIA_newconstructionmethod_desc코0=By adopting new construction methods we can work towards the gradual industrialisation and economic development of [SIA.GetName].
SIA_contractswithchaiseri코0=Contracts with Chaiseri
SIA_contractswithchaiseri_desc코0=Founded as a civilian truck part company, Chaiseri has gained some insights into heavy machinery production and wants us to fund their armoured car project as a testbed for future combat vehicles.
SIA_rubberplantations코0=Southern Rubber Plantations
SIA_rubberplantations_desc코0=Exploitation of the rubber plantations in the south should be considered a vital national industry in this day and age and can help us stimulate trade as nations around the world look for sources beyond Singapore.
SIA_thairungcars코0=Thairung's [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Cars
SIA_thairungcars_desc코0=By investing in new car models we can promote personal mobility and develop vehicles for military use.
SIA_prototypetankdesign코0=Prototype Tank Design
SIA_prototypetankdesign_desc코0=We must bring together all of the brilliant military minds that [SIA.GetSIAshortname] possesses and fund the creation of a prototype tank design, harkening back to the prototype built during Rama VI's reign, to help stimulate our armaments industry while also gaining an edge over any potential enemies.
SIA_petrochemicaldepartment코0=The Petrochemical Department
SIA_petrochemicaldepartment_desc코0=By creating a new authority for the extraction of coal, oil, lignite and tar we can ensure that the process of refining and processing of petroleum is better managed and more efficiently carried out.
SIA_new_forestry_concessions코0=New Forestry Concessions
SIA_new_forestry_concessions_desc코0=By opening up virgin forests in the north to the logging companies, we can hopefully provide more jobs in the northern parts of the country. This will assist in job creation in the frontiers while providing the badly needed timber for public work projects elsewhere.
SIA_nakhonsiwolfram코0=Tungsten Mines in Nakhon Si Thammarat
SIA_nakhonsiwolfram_desc코0=Tungsten is an incredibly crucial resource that allows for production of modern electronics and the creation of new industrial tools.
SIA_kanchanaburiironreservoir코0=Exploit Kanchanaburi's Iron Reservoir
SIA_kanchanaburiironreservoir_desc코0=Exploiting the 'iron reservoir' in Kanchanaburi will provide a vital source of iron for the nation's strategic interests and help to galvanise the growth of domestic steel.
SIA_expandloeimines코0=Expand the Loei Iron Mines
SIA_expandloeimines_desc코0=Expanding the iron mines in Loei should be a top priority, as productive of iron ore and steel is vital to a modern economy. Additionally, this will help to reduce unemployment and keep people working.
SIA_tigereconomy코0=Tiger Club Economy
SIA_tigereconomy_desc코0=Through our policy of economic revitalisation via investment into key industries, alongside new research methods, we have managed to massively increase the wealth of our people and the nation.

### Agricultural Path ###
SIA_agriculuralmechanisation코0=Agricultural Mechanisation
SIA_agriculuralmechanisation_desc코0=Rice paddy uses over half of the arable land in [SIA.GetName], yet it consists mainly of peasants farming small areas and producing modest amounts of rice. By providing cheap, low-interest loans for the purchase of tractors and modern equipment we can free some of these farmers from the rice fields and send them to the factories instead, without compromising crop yields.
SIA_agrarianscoop코0=Agricultural Co-operatives
SIA_agrarianscoop_desc코0=While the first [SIA.GetProperAdjective] co-op was created back in 1916, co-ops themselves aren't a common sight among rural communities yet. By persuading rice farmers to pool their savings together and organize into co-ops they will have enough money to buy the badly needed farming equipment in these hard times and obtain greater bargaining power against the rice merchants.
SIA_communalapproach코0=A Communal Approach
SIA_communalapproach_desc코0=Rice is central to [SIA.GetProperAdjective] society. Our farmers have long resisted to government intervention and embraced egalitarian methods, exchanging labour with other farmers to cover their needs. By focusing on these aspects of [SIA.GetProperAdjective] society and encouraging further community cooperation we can build a better country, while guarding against aristocrats and landlords.
SIA_newfarmingtheory코0=Model Farm Initiative
SIA_newfarmingtheory_desc코0=By creating 'Model Farms' throughout the country, where rice farmers can study new farming techniques and crop diversification, farmers can improve how they utilize their lands and thus greatly increase output.
SIA_selfsufficiencyeconomics코0=Economic Self-Sufficiency
SIA_selfsufficiencyeconomics_desc코0=Our plans to boost rice cultivation have worked incredibly well so far, and a dizzying amount agricultural surplus is available. We can now fully focus on our industrialisation plan.
SIA_exportrice코0=Export-Oriented Rice Production
SIA_exportrice_desc코0=Rice is central to [SIA.GetProperAdjective] society. Rice production normally does not amount to much more than the farmer needs to survive, leaving very little to profit from. If necessary, we can collaborate with large rice merchants and mills to supply a market pressure for more production, or we can simply obligate the farmers to produce more by increasing their rice tax.
SIA_ricesubsidyscheme코0=Rice Subsidy Scheme
SIA_ricesubsidyscheme_desc코0=By creating incentives for those farmers who have accomplished huge increases in their rice output and allowing peasants to own the land they've cleared for agricultural purposes we can provide simple market incentives to cultivate more land and increase crop yields.
SIA_worldgranary코0=Granary of the World
SIA_worldgranary_desc코0=We're now one of the largest rice exporters in the world, even if the peasantry does feel a touch exploited.

### Transportation Path ###
SIA_nationalhighway코0=National Highway Commission
SIA_nationalhighway_desc코0=The expansion of Route 3 (Sukhumvit Road: Bangkok - Rayong) and Route 1 (Vachiravut Road: Bangkok - Lopburi) has been considered by the government for some time now - with the creation of the National Highway Commission perhaps things will progress more smoothly.
SIA_railwaygauge코0=Standardisation of the Railway Gauge
SIA_railwaygauge_desc코0=Owing to the different standards of foreign nations and extractive purpose of [SIA.GetName]'s railroads, our rolling stock is different from province to province. By beginning a long-term project of standardising the railways we can make it easier to link up our cities in future.
SIA_isanrailway코0=Isan Railway Expansion
SIA_isanrailway_desc코0=Being the largest single region of the [SIA.GetProperAdjective] nation, and a key zone between our Cambodian and Laotian provinces, Isan's transport links are of vital national interest.
SIA_southernrailway코0=Southern Railway Expansion
SIA_southernrailway_desc코0=
SIA_northernrailway코0=Northern Railway Expansion
SIA_northernrailway_desc코0=
SIA_maritimesilkroad코0=Maritime Silk Road Initiative
SIA_maritimesilkroad_desc코0=
SIA_transtensassarimrailway코0=Trans-Tenasserim Railway
SIA_transtensassarimrailway_desc코0=
SIA_maptaphuthawaiport코0=Maptaphut-Thawai Port Facilities
SIA_maptaphuthawaiport_desc코0=
SIA_kloengtoeidocks코0=Klongtoei Dockyards
SIA_kloengtoeidocks_desc코0=
SIA_expandmapthaphut코0=Maptaphut Expansion
SIA_expandmapthaphut_desc코0=
SIA_merchantmarines코0=Modern Merchant Marines
SIA_foreigninvestment코0=Foreign Investments
SIA_twooceantradinghub코0=Two-Ocean Trading Hub

### Army Path ###
SIA_royalsiamesearmy코0=[SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Army
SIA_royalsiamesearmy_desc코0=First formed in 1874, as a response to new security threats brought in by the 1855 Bowing treaty (which opened us to international trade) - the army is the oldest and largest branch in the [SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Armed Forces, fulfilling its role as the protector of our sovereignty.
SIA_phibunsongkhramplan코0=Phibunsongkhram's Reforms
SIA_phibunsongkhramplan_desc코0=The [SIA.GetName] will adopt a doctrine based on the advice of Luang Phibunsongkhram (Plaek Phibunsongkhram). Being well known for his translation of a French Weltkrieg-era Field Artillery manual into Thai, he advocates for a centralized and well-equipped army with the usage of artillery being the main focus.
SIA_seriroengritplan코0=Seriroengrit's Reforms
SIA_seriroengritplan_desc코0=The [SIA.GetName] will follow the advice of Luang Seriroengrit (Jarun Seriroengrit), the leader of the Phayap Army who fought off numerous cross-border raids from Burma post-British Revolution. His doctrine emphasizes the usage of a decentralized regional army command, composed mainly by militias. Similar to that of Switzerland.
SIA_phrayaphahonplan코0=Phahonpolpayuhasena's Plan
SIA_phrayaphahonplan_desc코0=The [SIA.GetName] will adopt the proposals of Phraya Phahonpolpayuhasena (Phot Phahonyothin). Studies at the Hauptkadettenanstalt during his younger years and experience of the German General Staff's work during the Weltkrieg have convinced him that proper planning is the key to victory.
SIA_jungletraining코0=Jungle Combat Training
SIA_jungletraining_desc코0=The harsh jungles of Indochina have long been a graveyard of empires, friend and foe alike. We must train all our troops to better operate in such hostile conditions.
SIA_femalecorps코0=Suranaree Battalion
SIA_femalecorps_desc코0=While 'Ja-Khlone', female palace guards, have been a common sight in the inner palace since the Ayutthayan era having female soldiers in active combat is on another level altogether. Luang Phibunsongkhram (Plaek Phibunsongkhram) himself has voiced limited support for the petition, but the question is still up in the air. Pursuing such measures is sure to anger traditionalists.
SIA_asymmetricalwarfare코0=Asymmetrical Warfare
SIA_asymmetricalwarfare_desc코0=By analysing the tactics employed by the Vietnamese in the Saigon Uprising -which quickly became the Indochinese Rebellion- and some of Luang Chumnanyutthasart (Phin Choonhavan)'s exploits in Shan back in 1928, we can gain some insight into effective placement of troops and how to fight in urban terrain.
SIA_newstandardrifle코0=New Standard Rifle
SIA_newstandardrifle_desc코0=The old Type 46 Siamese Mauser is prone to malfunction in our hot and humid climate, perhaps it's time to get a replacement?
SIA_artilleryresearchdivision코0=Artillery Research Divisions
SIA_artilleryresearchdivision_desc코0=Lead by Luang Wichitsongkhram (Jira Wichitsongkhram), the new artillery research division is responsible for designing our own native artillery to reduce the demand for imported artillery in the army.
SIA_defensetechnologyinstitute코0=Defence Technology Institute
SIA_defensetechnologyinstitute_desc코0=Satisfied with their most recent project; the old artillery research division will now be expanded and put in charge of other fields of military research, ensuring our armed forces at the cutting edge.
SIA_salacheepphurchard코0=For the Motherland!
SIA_salacheepphurchard_desc코0=Our ancestors have shed so much blood on this piece of land now called [SIA.GetSIAshortname], we shall make sure that their sacrifices aren't in vain.
SIA_expandsupportcapacity코0=Expand Support Team Capacity
SIA_expandsupportcapacity_desc코0='Taharn Chang' (Combat Engineers) and 'Taharn Khonsong' (Logistics Teams) are what kept our army working for so long during the Weltkrieg, let's give them better tools so that they can fulfil their role in a modern war.
SIA_armyaffairs코0=Army Reorganisation
SIA_armyaffairs_desc코0=Our army currently uses various rifle and artillery models, which has proved to be a logistical nightmare. By adopting a unified ammunition size for each gun type and phasing the old ones out or rechambering them to fire the new 8x52mmR Siamese rimmed caetridge, we will considerably help our supply issues.
SIA_specialforce코0=Special Warfare Command
SIA_specialforce_desc코0=Modelled after the German Luftlandetruppe and the Austrian Gebirgstruppe, 'Krom Songkhram Pisaet' will be responsible for recruiting and training our new specialized units capable of disrupting the enemy from behind their lines.
SIA_counterinsurgencytactics코0=Counter-Insurgency Tactics
SIA_counterinsurgencytactics_desc코0=Our Taharn Pran units have shown some success in detecting enemy infiltration on our border, perhaps they can also act as our eyes and ears in occupied zones too?
SIA_taharpran코0=Taharn Pran
SIA_taharpran_desc코0=Also known as '[SIA.GetProperAdjective] Rangers' in English, Taharn Pran is a paramilitary light infantry unit of the [SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Army composed of volunteers who are trained to patrol the borders. They act as a quick response force in case of foreign invasion. Local volunteers also make sure that we will always have the terrain advantage over the enemy.
SIA_royalmiltaryacademy코0=[SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] Military Academy
SIA_royalmiltaryacademy_desc코0=By merging the [SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Army Cadet School (est. 1887) with the [SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Army Polytechnique Institute, the newly created \"[SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] Military Academy\" should hopefully yield better graduates from cross-training with other branches of the military while save us money through the abolition of antiquated/duplicated courses in the new curriculum.
SIA_royalmunitionsfactory코0=[SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] Munitions Factory
SIA_royalmunitionsfactory_desc코0=Having enemies on all sides, [SIA.GetSIAshortname] nearly used up all her artillery shells during the Weltkrieg, with no means of being freshly supplied. This has resulted in a massive supply of artillery shells being hoarded by the paranoid logistics department over the years, but additional ammunition factories would definitely help us in the event of prolonged conflict.
SIA_industrialmobilization코0=Industrial Mobilisation Plan
SIA_industrialmobilization_desc코0=In the times of war, key industries will temporary be put under government control to ensure our nation's survival. While this has proved to be unpopular, it will keep our army adequately armed and increase our chance of winning this war.
SIA_phaopoliceintegration코0=Integration of the Police Command
SIA_phaopoliceintegration_desc코0=Police General Phao Sriyanond suggests that we should elevate the police force to the same level as the other 3 branches of the [SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Armed Forces. This will result in a more efficient organisation in case of emergency and extra funding for the under-armed police forces, but will also involve them taking a much larger cut of our tax money than ever before.
SIA_nationalreserveact코0=The National Reserve Act
SIA_nationalreserveact_desc코0="... All men aged between 18-45 with [SIA.GetProperAdjective] citizenship is required to be registered at their local barracks and finish their basic training course at least once, not doing so can result in being court marshalled by the Army..."\n\n-excerpt from 2484 B.E. the National Reserve Bill

### Navy Path ###
SIA_royalsiamesenavy코0=[SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Navy
SIA_royalsiamesenavy_desc코0=Established in 1887, the [SIA.GetSIAnavyName] has similar organisational structures to the United States Navy, since it is composed of both the naval fleet and the [SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Marine Corps. It was also the second Asian nation to acquire submarines, after Japan.
SIA_expandmarinescorps코0=Expand the Navikkayothin Corps
SIA_expandmarinescorps_desc코0=Although 'Taharn Ma-Rine' were first founded back in 1833, the unit served mostly as a royal honour guard throughout the 19th century. It was not until 1913 that the [SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Marine Corps were reorganized into the modern \"Navy Amphibious Assault Group\" who saw some action back in the Weltkrieg. Perhaps the marines can serve as yet another ace in the hole for the upcoming conflict?
SIA_improvedlandingcraft코0=Improved Landing Craft
SIA_improvedlandingcraft_desc코0=The [SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Marine Corps currently use ex-British merchant ships we seized back in the Weltkreig as their only mean of transportation. Having dedicated amphibious landing ships will make sure that our boys can embark and secure the beachhead faster.
SIA_newflagship코0=A New Flagship
SIA_newflagship_desc코0=As we are seriously outgunned by our neighbours having something that can reliably punch through battleship armour might be a good idea. This will also provide our seamen a sense of pride and accomplishment.
SIA_coastaldefenseships코0=Coastal Defence Ships
SIA_coastaldefenseships_desc코0=While these heavily armed cruisers are no match against German East Asiaflotte or Imperial Japanese Navy, and have limited capability in the high seas, they will surely serve our cash-strapped navy well, especially in the island-dotted coastal waters of both the Gulf of [SIA.GetSIAshortname] and the Andaman Sea.
SIA_riverpatolunit코0=Riverine Patrol Units
SIA_riverpatolunit_desc코0=Both the Salween and Mekong rivers serve as our natural fortification against enemy advances. By sending our promising junior captains to learn from their brown water counterparts they can learn a lesson or two about naval organisation.
SIA_destroyerfleet코0=Chumphon-Class Destroyers
SIA_destroyerfleet_desc코0=Named after late Admiral Prince Abhakara Kiartivongse, Prince of Chumphon, these new destroyer design will serve well as the backbone of our [SIA.GetSIAprefixTH]navi.
SIA_subships코0=The S-Ships Project
SIA_subships_desc코0=These 'Ruea-Sor's were first envisioned by late Mahidol Adulyadej, Prince of Songkhla, who studied at the Marineschule Mürwik, as 'essential' to the defence of Bangkok and by extension the Gulf of [SIA.GetSIAshortname]. While we have procured four small submarines for the first line of defence; continuing the second phase of the plan, which entails another 5 submarines for the outer defensive line, might be a good idea.
SIA_twooceannavy코0=A Two-Ocean Navy
SIA_twooceannavy_desc코0=Our navy is perhaps too small to face the Kaiserliche Marine or the IJN head-on. Some additional funding would definitely help.
SIA_expandsattahip코0=Expand Sattahip
SIA_expandsattahip_desc코0=Sattahip was first built as the [SIA.GetSIAnavyName]'s main naval base back in 1914. As the base is quite small and already reaching its support capacity limit, expansion of its facilities is definitely in order.
SIA_wolfpacks코0=Convoy Hunting
SIA_wolfpacks_desc코0=Being surrounded by bigger and more heavily armed navy, Admiral Luang Yutthasartkosol (Prayoon Yuthasartkosol) suggests we play hide-and-seek with the enemy fleet instead of facing them head-on. All the while sniping them from afar with our torpedoes.
SIA_alargefleet코0=Fleet in Being
SIA_alargefleet_desc코0=Being surrounded by bigger and more heavily armed navy, Admiral Luang Kamolnavin (Sindhu Kamolnavin) wants us to get all the firepower we can get to knock the enemy battleships out of the fight and, if possible, sink them.

### Air Forces Path ###
SIA_royalsiameseaircorps코0=[SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Air Corps
SIA_royalsiameseaircorps_desc코0=First founded in 1913 as the Royal Flying Corps, our flyboys have helped us achieve numerous victories by assisting us from the sky.
