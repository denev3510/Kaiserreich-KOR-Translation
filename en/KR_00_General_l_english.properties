### Events ###
kr.political.100.t코0=Order Restored in [Root.GetNameDef]
kr.political.100.d코0=While [Root.GetNameDef] still labours under [overlord_name.GetAdjective] control, the [Root.GetAdjective] military has asserted enough control over our own borders that a semblance of greater autonomy is now possible to exert. This is not independence - far from it - but it does mean we no longer have to rely on [overlord_name.GetAdjective] troops to secure our borders.
kr.political.100.a코0=Excellent

kr.political.101.t코0=Order Restored in [From.GetNameDef]
kr.political.101.d코0=While [From.GetNameDef] still labours under [Root.GetAdjective] control, the [From.GetAdjective] military has asserted enough control over its own borders that a semblance of autonomy is now possible. This is not independence - far from it - but it does mean they no longer have to rely on [Root.GetAdjective] troops to secure their borders, and are thus not so tightly under our control.
kr.political.101.a코0=So be it

kr.political.102.t코0=Greater [Root.GetAdjective] Autonomy?
kr.political.102.d.tfv코0=[Root.GetNameDefCap] remains under the control of the [overlord_name.GetAdjective] government, but that control is beginning to surely lessen as our strength reasserts itself. [Root.GetAdjective] power is not something to be easily contained, and already our leaders are clamouring for more control over our own affairs. Surely our [overlord_name.GetAdjective] will not be able to resist us for long.
kr.political.102.d코0=[Root.GetNameDefCap] remains under the control of the [overlord_name.GetAdjective] government, but that control is beginning to lessen as our strength reasserts itself. [Root.GetAdjective] power is not something to be easily contained, and already our leaders are clamouring for more control over our own affairs, and the effect is being felt throughout the country.
kr.political.102.a코0=Long live [Root.GetNameDef]!

kr.political.103.t코0=Greater [From.GetAdjective] Autonomy
kr.political.103.d코0=[From.GetNameDefCap] remains under the control of the [Root.GetAdjective] government, but that control is beginning to lessen as their strength reasserts itself. [From.GetAdjective] power is not something to be easily contained, and the clamouring of their leaders for more control over their own affairs is being felt throughout the country.
kr.political.103.a코0=We will need to watch this carefully

kr.political.106.t코0=The Struggle for Independence
kr.political.106.d.tfv코0=[overlord_name.GetAdjective] control over the [Root.GetAdjective] government has been slipping for some time, now. We are too powerful for them to contain. There is a general clamouring among the [Root.GetAdjective] people for [Root.GetNameDef] to become free, and soon our time will come.
kr.political.106.d코0=[overlord_name.GetAdjective] control over the [Root.GetAdjective] government has been slipping for some time, now. We are too powerful for them to contain. There is a general clamouring among the [Root.GetAdjective] people for [Root.GetNameDef] to become free, and it seems we must decide whether we will demand our independence from [overlord_name.GetNameDef].
kr.political.106.a코0=Long live a free [Root.GetName]!
kr.political.106.b코0=Yes, we must demand our independence
kr.political.106.c코0=No, best not to poke the hornet's nest

kr.political.107.t코0=[From.GetNameDefCap] Demands Independence
kr.political.107.d코0=[Root.GetAdjective] control over the [From.GetAdjective] government has been slipping for some time, now. They are too powerful for us to fully contain. There is a general clamouring among the [From.GetAdjective] people for [From.GetNameDef] to be set free, and now their government has officially submitted a demand for full independence.
kr.political.107.a코0=Let them go, while we're still friends
kr.political.107.b코0=Are they joking? Forget it

kr.political.108.t코0=Independence Refused
kr.political.108.d코0=The [From.GetAdjective] government has dismissed our demand for independence. While we are only nominally under their control as it is, still the restrictions chafe at us.
kr.political.108.a코0=This does not end here

KR_fight_for_independence코0=Declare Independence
KR_fight_for_independence_desc코0=[From.GetNameDefCap] may have refused our demand for independence, but that is not the end of the matter. We will be free, even if we must fight for it!

kr.political.109.t코0=[From.GetNameDefCap] Declares Independence
kr.political.109.d코0=It seems our refusal to grant [From.GetNameDef] independence wasn't enough for them. They have declared themselves free of [Root.GetAdjective] control, anyhow.
kr.political.109.a코0=Bah! Let them go
kr.political.109.b코0=We'll see about that!

kr.political.110.t코0=The War for Independence
kr.political.110.d코0=It seems our former overlord can't gain a clear foothold in [Root.GetNameDef]... but neither can we defeat them. Perhaps it is time to call for a truce and end this?
kr.political.110.a코0=Yes, let's end this
kr.political.110.b코0=No! This is about more than independence now!

kr.political.111.t코0=The [From.GetAdjective] War for Independence
kr.political.111.d코0=The war with [From.GetNameDef] has gone on for some time, with neither of us able to gain a clear advantage. Perhaps it is time to simply recognise their independence and be done with it.
kr.political.111.a코0=Yes, let's end this
kr.political.111.b코0=No! We will finish this!

kr.political.250.t코0=Puppet [marked_country.GetNameDef]?
kr.political.250.d코0=This will turn [marked_country.GetNameDef] into a subject of [to_be_overlord.GetNameDef], using the default Occupied Puppet autonomous state. If they're in a different faction, they will leave it, but this won't end any of the current wars they're in. If you want to do that, you should do it separately.\n\n§RNOTE: This may very well break Kaiserreich content! Use at your own risk!!§!
kr.political.250.a코0=Do it
kr.political.250.b코0=Do it, but let them keep their current government
kr.political.250.c코0=On second thought...

kr.political.251.t코0=Free [marked_country.GetNameDef]?
kr.political.251.d코0=This will make [marked_country.GetNameDef] completely independent. It will not change their current government (unless the mod has content to do so automatically), not remove [marked_country.GetNameDef] from their faction, if they're in one, nor take them out of any wars.\n\n§RNOTE: This may very well break Kaiserreich content! Use at your own risk!!§!

kr.political.252.t코0=Join the [to_be_faction_leader.GetFactionName]?
kr.political.252.d코0=This will make [marked_country.GetNameDef] join the [to_be_faction_leader.GetFactionName], dismantling their own faction if they're a faction leader or simply leaving their current faction if they're in one. This won't change any wars they're currently in.\n\n§RNOTE: This may very well break Kaiserreich content! Use at your own risk!!§!

kr.political.253.t코0=Lead the [marked_country.GetFactionName]?
kr.political.253.d코0=This will make [marked_country.GetNameDef] faction leader for the [marked_country.GetFactionName].\n\n§RNOTE: This may very well break Kaiserreich content! Use at your own risk!!§!

kr.political.254.t코0=Leave the [marked_country.GetFactionName]?
kr.political.254.d코0=This will make [marked_country.GetNameDef] leave the [marked_country.GetFactionName], dismantling the faction if they are the leader. It will not affect any wars they are currently in.\n\n§RNOTE: This may very well break Kaiserreich content! Use at your own risk!!§!

kr.political.255.t코0=Peace with [peace_target.GetNameDef]?
kr.political.255.d코0=[marked_country.GetNameDefCap], along with all its allies, will white peace with [peace_target.GetNameDef] and all of their allies.\n\n§RNOTE: This may very well break Kaiserreich content! Use at your own risk!!§!
kr.political.255.b코0=Separate [marked_country.GetNameDef] from its allies, then peace out

kr.political.256.t코0=Peace out of all wars?
kr.political.256.d코0=[marked_country.GetNameDefCap] will make a separate white peace for all its current wars. If it is a subject, it will first be freed, and if it is in a faction, it must first leave it.\n\n§RNOTE: This may very well break Kaiserreich content! Use at your own risk!!§!

kr.political.257.t코0=War with [war_target.GetNameDef]?
kr.political.257.d코0=[marked_country.GetNameDefCap] will declare war on [war_target.GetNameDef]. There are no checks to see if this is a valid declaration, other than the two countries are not allies and not already at war.\n\n§RNOTE: This may very well break Kaiserreich content! Use at your own risk!!§!

### Unit Leader Events ###
unit_leader.1.t코0=[From.GetName] Falls Ill
unit_leader.1.d코0=In [From.GetHerHis] service to the nation, it seems [From.GetRank] [From.GetName] has pushed [From.GetHerselfHimself] too far. As a result of the bad climate in [From.GetHerHis] operational area, the [From.GetRank] has now fallen ill, and will likely need some time to recover. Until [From.GetSheHe] gets well, [From.GetSheHe] will not be performing at [From.GetHerHis] usual level.
unit_leader.1.a코0=Unfortunate.

unit_leader.2.t코0=[From.GetName] Wounded
unit_leader.2.d코0=In bringing the battle to a successful conclusion, it seems [From.GetRank] [From.GetName] put [From.GetHerselfHimself] at a bit too much risk while leading [From.GetHerHis] men. [From.GetSheHeCap] has been wounded, and it will likely take some time for the wounds to fully heal, until which time the [From.GetRank] will not be performing at [From.GetHerHis] usual level.
unit_leader.2.a코0=Unfortunate.

### Government in Exile Events ###
mtg_exile_leader_added.1.t코0=[exile_nation.GetAdjective] Exile Leader Offers Service
mtg_exile_leader_added.1.desc코0=After a long and hazardous journey through enemy-held territory and several neutral states, a high ranking military officer from one of our capitulated allies has finally arrived in the capital. Following a short period of recovery, he has offered his services in our common struggle.
mtg_exile_leader_added.1.a코0=Your fight is not over yet.

mtg_exile_government.2.title코0=The [From.GetAdjective] Government in Exile
mtg_exile_government.2.desc코0=[From.GetLeader] has formally requested permission from the [Root.GetAdjective] government to return to [From.GetNameDef] and re-establish a provisional [From.GetRulingParty] cabinet in preparation for the post-war peace.
mtg_exile_government.2.a코0=It is time for them to return to their own territory.
mtg_exile_government.2.b코0=The time is not yet ripe.

mtg_exile_government.3.title코0=[From.GetName] Requests Naval Integration
mtg_exile_government.3.desc코0=The [From.GetAdjective] naval leadership has presented us with a plan for the integration of our navy into theirs. They argue that, by allowing [From.GetAdjective] naval planners to have full control over our ships, their effectiveness would be drastically increased in comparison to their current independent actions.
mtg_exile_government.3.a코0=We agree.
mtg_exile_government.3.b코0=We will not serve under them.

mtg_exile_government.4.title코0=[From.GetName] Accepts Naval Integration
mtg_exile_government.4.desc코0=The [From.GetAdjective] government has informed us that they agree to our proposal, and that henceforth their ships will operate under our command.
mtg_exile_government.4.a코0=Excellent.

mtg_exile_government.5.title코0=[From.GetName] Rejects Naval Integration
mtg_exile_government.5.desc코0=The [From.GetAdjective] government has informed us that their navy will never serve under the command of a foreign power. They mean to aid us, but they shall do so independently.
mtg_exile_government.5.a코0=They place their pride above the interests of the alliance.

mtg_generic.1.title코0=[From.GetName] Enforces Government Change
mtg_generic.1.desc코0=Citing the clear lack of electoral support for our current government, [From.GetNameDef] has demanded a change in politics.
mtg_generic.1.a코0=We have no choice but to accept.

### Generic Focus Localisation ###
generic_focus코0=National Focus
### Generic Ideas ###
generic_liberty_idea코0=Spirit Of Freedom
generic_liberty_idea_desc코0=Freedom is something we have pledged to preserve, and this inspires our population to support us even if they may not always agree with our policies or the state of the country in the present moment.
generic_militarism_focus코0=Militarism
generic_militarism_focus_desc코0=Our people have come to see the army as an integral part of our nation, and every conscript plays his part. This allows us to mobilise reserves, militia and other paramilitary forces in a pinch.
generic_military_youth_focus코0=Military Youth
generic_military_youth_focus_desc코0=From the youngest age, our citizens learn military values and integrate them as a part of their life. This obviously increases the amount of vocations for the army as they reach adulthood.
generic_ideological_fanaticism_focus코0=Ideological Fanaticism
generic_ideological_fanaticism_focus_desc코0=Our country is the centre of our ideology, and our ideology is the fabric of the country. Many are ready to die for its survival when others would easily retreat to new positions.
generic_liberty_research_idea코0=University Grants
generic_liberty_research_idea_desc코0=We are paying modest but still relatively decent university grants to ensure any aspiring student has a shot at higher education. This is bound to increase the size of our intelligentsia
generic_welfare_idea코0=Welfare Programs
generic_welfare_idea_desc코0=We are ensuring that the poorest in our society receive the help they need to survive, so that they do not have to fend for themselves and may work for our economy one day.

### Generic Focuses ###
generic_army_effort코0=Modern Warfare
generic_army_effort_desc코0=The Weltkrieg, from its start to its end, changed warfare forever by finally ending Napoleonic Warfare's grasp on military thought and confirming the extreme deadliness of the rifle, machine gun and artillery cannon. Our army must adapt or perish, in a literal sense.
generic_equipment_effort코0=Equipment Modernisation
generic_equipment_effort_desc코0=For a long time, military breakthroughs were slow, and having a good bolt-action rifle was enough. However, these rifles of the 19th Century are completely out of place on a post-Weltkrieg battlefield. We must stop being complacent and get new equipment.
generic_motorization_effort코0=Army Motorisation
generic_motorization_effort_desc코0=The cavalry charges of the Weltkrieg were probably the last. The truck is no longer just a transport tool and is rapidly integrated into mobile warfare tactics. We must shake off outdated thinking and use motorisation to speed up our offensives and reinforcements.
generic_doctrine_effort코0=Studying the Weltkrieg
generic_doctrine_effort_desc코0=We know about the Weltkrieg, but what have we learned from it? In just five years of conflict, countless soldiers died to teach us the new dynamics of warfare. If we do not learn about them, then our soldiers will meet the same fate on the battlefield.
generic_equipment_effort_2코0=Equipment Research
generic_equipment_effort_2_desc코0=We might have caught up to modern equipment, but new designs are already making ours obsolete. Regardless, we must persevere, and make sure that we never fall a single year behind in equipment. This means we will have to start developing our own designs.
generic_mechanization_effort코0=Mechanised Warfare
generic_mechanization_effort_desc코0=Trucks fared poorly on the frontlines, but it seems that we can now meet halfway between trucks and tanks. Armoured personal carriers can bring troops directly into combat, shield them from fire, and even provide powerful fire support if needed.
generic_doctrine_effort_2코0=Military Exercises
generic_doctrine_effort_2_desc코0=Every great power exercises, and so should we. War games are more than peacetime entertainment for generals, they allow us to test both true and tested and revolutionary tactics without wasting countless lives. This allows us to complete our theoretical discoveries.
generic_equipment_effort_3코0=Equipment Breakthroughs
generic_equipment_effort_3_desc코0=We have come to such an experience in equipment research that we are no longer limited to eternally catching up or buying foreign equipment to get cutting-edge military gear. Even great powers may soon be surprised by what will soon be in our soldiers' hands.
generic_armor_effort코0=Armoured Warfare
generic_armor_effort_desc코0=Tanks are the pinnacle of modern warfare. Mobile vehicles armed with cannons worthy of artillery, and impervious to the average rifle. Even if we only produce few, we will plough through our enemies with judicious use of those steel behemoths.
generic_special_forces코0=Special Forces
generic_special_forces_desc코0=Special Forces are more than the Elite Units of old. With modern equipment, even a conscript can hold his own on the battlefield. However, some situations are so hostile that they need specially trained men. Mountain ranges, amphibious landings, airborne assaults.

generic_aviation_effort코0=National Air Force
generic_aviation_effort_tt코0=Not enough building slots for §YAir Base§!
generic_aviation_effort_desc코0=The field of aviation was born almost in time for the Weltkrieg. Even two decades after this war, it is still new, and all nations strive to be ready for the next time their planes may be called to war. We must, too. We must found a solid Air Force to organise them.
generic_fighter_focus코0=Air Superiority
generic_fighter_focus_desc코0=The dogfights of the Weltkrieg were merely the start of air-to-air warfare. As planes become faster, more armoured and more heavily armed, we need to put all our efforts into making sure we control the air. Then, striking the ground is a formality.
generic_bomber_focus코0=Strategic Bombing
generic_bomber_focus_desc코0=Even when they were brand new, bombers inspired fear, and many saw their potential. As payloads get larger and bigger, even the artillery barrages of the Weltkrieg fail to compare. Some day, we may even surpass them, and destroy entire cities or regions in one run.
generic_aviation_effort_2코0=Modern Air Tactics
generic_aviation_effort_2_desc코0=Planes have long stopped being just reconnaissance and harassment tools. By integrating them fully into our army operations, the air force is capable of dealing as much damage and advancing our operations as much as the average Army Command.
generic_CAS_effort코0=Close Air Support
generic_CAS_effort_desc코0=While Fighters and Bombers can indirectly affect the battle, dedicated CAS planes have both the agility and armament needed to perform strafe and bombing runs on ground targets, causing major damage on unprepared armies while handling decently in aerial combat.
generic_rocket_effort코0=Experimental Rocketry
generic_rocket_effort_desc코0=The field of rocketry is perhaps one of the newest fields of military science. If our scientists are to be believed, rocket engines can achieve speeds that would put radial engines to shame. Some say they could go even faster than sound, certainly extremely exciting.
generic_NAV_effort코0=Naval Aviation
generic_NAV_effort_desc코0=Perhaps one of the major breakthroughs in naval warfare, naval bombers are able to lay waste on enemy fleets with torpedoes and other dedicated naval payloads like mines. Supporting our fleets, they can challenge capital ships and wreak havoc in the naval screens.

generic_naval_effort코0=Modern Dockyards
generic_naval_effort_tt코0=Not enough building slots for §YNaval Dockyards§!
generic_naval_effort_desc코0=If we are to establish a strong navy, we need to produce it first. Shipbuilding methods have evolved, and old drydocks need to be upgraded as much as new dockyards must be built from scratch. The modern ship is no cog, and we must see big to have a sea-worthy fleet.
generic_flexible_navy코0=Flexible Tactics
generic_flexible_navy_desc코0=We will never have the navies of the world powers, able to clean entire seas of opposition, but this does not mean our fleet will hide in port. Using flexible tactics and modern inventions like submarines, we do not need to actually match up with those grand fleets to wreak havoc.
generic_large_navy코0=Power Projection
generic_large_navy_desc코0=Our navy might not yet be able to contest the bigger navies of this world, but by picking our fights smartly and keeping our fleets focused, we can make sure that any confrontation is to our advantage while still retaining a powerful navy that can rout weaker navies.
generic_submarine_effort코0=Submarine Warfare
generic_submarine_effort_desc코0=Submarine warfare is the most exciting naval development since the invention of the torpedo boat, and challenges even the most classical doctrines of naval warfare. We would do well to not just protect against submarines, but also use them against enemy ships.
generic_cruiser_effort코0=Screen Ships
generic_cruiser_effort_desc코0=Cruisers are not just 'cheap Battleships', and such outdated thinking ruins the potential of those ships. We should use them as escorts to our capital ships, as they are very vulnerable to naval bombers and smaller ships like torpedo boats.
generic_destroyer_effort코0=Anti-Submarine Warfare
generic_destroyer_effort_desc코0=By studying the design and strategic use of submarines, we also learn how to counter them. Our Destroyers will need specialised equipment like depth charges and specific designs that are both light and small to ensure they can escort convoys and patrol efficiently.
generic_capital_ships_effort코0=Capital Ships
generic_capital_ships_effort_desc코0=Eventually, a fleet is nothing without a centrepiece, and both the old Battleship and modern Carrier fit this role. While vulnerable in a direct confrontation, they can bring massive damage upon enemy fleets if we let them shell and swarm the enemy ships from a safe distance.

generic_industrial_effort코0=Industrial Methods
generic_industrial_effort_desc코0=To construct a large industrial base, we will need to set up the basics of modern industry, and maybe even make initial choices. Concentrated or dispersed industrial centres, investing in machine tools and construction tools. All of those are important things to focus on.
generic_construction_effort코0=Industrial Grants
generic_construction_effort_tt코0=Not enough building slots for §YCivilian Factories§!
generic_construction_effort_desc코0=A healthy and strong industry doesn't just appear out of nowhere. While we may have to start more ambitious projects later, we must start by ensuring that those with good management skills can start healthy, successful companies that may later grow into giants.
generic_production_effort코0=State Armouries
generic_production_effort_tt코0=Not enough building slots for §YMilitary Factory§!
generic_production_effort_desc코0=Until we are able to produce our own military equipment, we should create modern armouries for our army. Their goal is quite modest, procuring the gear our army needs using state funds, civilian production and simple production, but it is better than not getting any new rifles.
generic_construction_effort_2코0=Industrial Centres
generic_construction_effort_2_desc코0=Entrepreneurship is one thing, but to have an economy worthy of even a regional power, we will need to foster the large industrial regions that made the Industrial Revolution. The seeds of such regions are a large investment into promising industrial sites.
generic_production_effort_2코0=Military Manufactures
generic_production_effort_2_desc코0=We must produce our own military equipment if we want our army to be more than a reserve force. The only way to do so is to heavily fund the creation of dedicated military manufactures, and support them with regular contracts and promises to ensure they can stay afloat.
generic_production_effort_3코0=Military Industry
generic_production_effort_3_desc코0=We have finally reached a point where we have companies able to build the equipment we need, even if their output is still limited. However, our needs are still great, and by giving them absolute support over foreign companies they will slowly scale up to our needs.
generic_infrastructure_effort코0=National Infrastructure
generic_infrastructure_effort_desc코0=Our growing industry requires a solid infrastructure to ensure the transit of goods. We need to do away with the chaotic, city to city planning and finally draw the roads of our country. Those who exist, those who will be expanded or linked, and those that have yet to be.
generic_infrastructure_effort_tt코0=Not enough building slots for §YInfrastructure§!
generic_synth_oil_effort_tt코0=Not enough building slots for §YSynthetic Refinery§!
generic_infrastructure_effort_2코0=Railway Networks
generic_infrastructure_effort_2_desc코0=Modern countries need railway networks, able to bring anything from one point of the country to another rapidly and efficiently. This means we will have to expand our railways and create junctions that didn't occur to us even a few years ago.
generic_construction_effort_3코0=Industrial Networks
generic_construction_effort_3_desc코0=Much like roads and railways, industries are connected in large, sprawling networks, based on input and output, import and export. As our infrastructure improves, so do these links, and our industry grows stronger as they can rely on the economy of our few wealthy provinces.

generic_extra_tech_slot코0=Research Councils
generic_extra_tech_slot_desc코0=Our industrial growth has attracted many learned minds, both nationals and foreign scientists looking for employment. We should fund research councils to ensure that they find tasks to work on until our industrial base grows enough that we attract private research institutes.
generic_extra_tech_slot_2코0=Research Institutes
generic_extra_tech_slot_2_desc코0=As our industrial base expands, we finally go from just manufacturing to actually designing and creating, or at least attracting those who do. Those research institutes have not only the minds, but also the funds to make discoveries. Let us waste no time encouraging their implantation.
generic_technology_sharing코0=Technology Sharing
generic_technology_sharing_desc코0=By sharing technological advances with our allies, our whole faction will be able to conduct wartime research and development more efficiently. Of course, we will need to prove our help is impactful to them, but once this much is proved, we stand to benefit greatly from their research.
generic_secret_weapons코0=Secret Weapons
generic_secret_weapons_desc코0=It is tempting to expend all extra resources into just developing tanks and planes, but the secret to winning wars lies in whole new fields of science; electronics, rocketry and nuclear research. Just because we are not a major power, does not mean we cannot make our own strides in those fields.

generic_political_effort코0=Political Reform
generic_political_effort_desc코0=To bring about change in the world, we need to be able to bring about change in our own country. Strengthening our political position should come first, we need to do away with old political doctrine and be ready to adopt bold, ambitious views on how our nation is to be ruled from now on.
generic_collectivist_ethos_kr코0=Unite The Nation
generic_collectivist_ethos_kr_desc코0=This era is a strange one, with the rise of Syndicalism, the fragile position of Democracy and the maintained Authoritarian old order. We must protect our country from outside influences by ensuring our people believe in the founding values of our country, lest we are washed away by opposing views.
generic_militarism코0=Militarism
generic_militarism_desc코0=Those who view the military as a necessary evil are doomed to hesitate in the face of war. We will ingrain militarism into our culture to become a people of soldiers, if not an army with a state. If one thing is certain since the Weltkrieg, it is that it might very well not have been The War To End War.
generic_military_youth코0=Military Youth
generic_military_youth_desc코0=Organisations to promote discipline and political education of young people in our nation will foster loyalty and self-sacrifice early in a citizen's life. These core values must be learned from the most tender age, so that the next generations are ready to fight for our country.
generic_ideological_fanaticism코0=Ideological Fanaticism
generic_ideological_fanaticism_desc코0=Our politically established values and goals are worth dying for as much as any ancient faith. Any follower should be prepared to face death, and those who stray better be prepared to face death. There is no middle ground in this ideological struggle of the great and small powers alike.
generic_liberty_ethos_kr코0=Spirit Of Freedom
generic_liberty_ethos_kr_desc코0=Freedom is not just a happy happenstance, it is something that must be preserved against tyranny. The Weltkrieg and the rise of Syndicalism has too many put this spirit in doubt, but no nation is too small to rekindle its flame in their governments and populaces and ward against those trying to extinguish it.
generic_rights_of_man코0=The Rights Of Man
generic_rights_of_man_desc코0=The Rights Of Man is perhaps the founding act of the modern Democracy, doing away with the feudal order and ensuring equal rights for all. There have always been the odd doubts about our stance on those essential rights, and we will dispel them without ambiguity. We only stand to benefit from it.
generic_liberty_research코0=University Grants
generic_liberty_research_desc코0=The modern University is a great achievement, allowing people of even modest origin to elevate themselves via higher learning. However, this requires us to fund university grants to allow such access to poorer but aspiring students. Let's make that move now, these future scholars will pay dividends.
generic_welfare코0=Welfare Programs
generic_welfare_desc코0=Equality in rights and equality in education are two important milestones, but economic equality is perhaps the hardest. While we might never reach perfect equality in this area, we can at least prop up the poorest in our country with fair welfare programs. This ought to help our consumer economy speed up, too.
generic_national_identity코0=National Identity
generic_national_identity_desc코0=While the ideological debate is one we could get lost in for ages, we must not forget who we are at our core. We are unique, we know our history, our culture and we hope that our destiny is even more brilliant. If we have shaped a better society today, we will shape an even better country tomorrow.
