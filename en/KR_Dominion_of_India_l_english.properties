### Leaders ###
POLITICS_GEORGE_FIFTH_DESC코0=The years since the Weltkrieg have seen much trouble in the British Raj, with the British Revolution of 1925 being the catalyst for many of the events since, but the loyalty to the King-Emperor George remained steadfast among some of his Indian subjects, particularly those in the north. But one, unsinkable truth for the King-Emperor is that the new Dominion is no Raj- it is but just a shaving of the Jewel of the Crown. No longer does the Crown maintain an iron grip on the subcontinent, but a loose alliance with the north- a truth that does not help the demeanour of the King-Emperor in the slightest, and a truth that sits uncomfortably with the Delhi Government, of whom many members wish to break all ties with the King-Emperor and declare home rule. For now, the King-Emperor still rules, but his power is diminished and his roar is now a soft bark.
POLITICS_EDWARD_DELHI_DESC코0=Edward of Windsor, with the passing of his father, 'King-Emperor', George V, was crowned in a lavish ceremony in Ottawa. The young monarch, notably solemn upon his enthronement, inherited an Empire undoubtedly a shadow of its former glory, and a kingdom occupied by syndicalist revolutionaries. Undeterred, King Edward maintains, above all else, the desire that the banner of the United Kingdom again proudly fly above the British Isles.
POLITICS_CHAMBER_OF_PRINCES_DESC코0=The Chamber of Princes was originally established by King-Emperor George V during the Weltkrieg to appease the increasingly unruly Indian nobility. The instability and political violence that followed the British revolution necessitated that, to maintain authority, the unelected Chamber was delegated substantial governmental authority, and eventually reorganized into the proper upper-house of the now bi-cameral Indian legislature. Upon the death of the viceroy of India, the Chamber is responsible for appointing a successor.
POLITICS_GANGA_SINGH_DESC코0=Ganga Singh, prince of Bikaner, proved a capable military leader during the Weltkrieg, eventually becoming the only Indian member of the British Imperial War Cabinet. Not just a military man however, Singh proved to be an astute politician, gaining a substantial following by advocating sweeping yet gradual reform of India's convoluted political system. In his push for reform however, Singh maintained cordiality with the British administration, and gained the admiration of sympathetic aristocrats. Due to his popularity, Singh's support was crucial for then Viceroy, Rufus Isaacs, in transforming India from an appendage of the British Empire into an independent Dominion.
POLITICS_RATANJI_DADABHOY_TATA_DESC코0=Jehangir Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata, son of perhaps India's most famous industrialist, after whom Jehangir is named, fled his native Paris during the Weltkrieg, shortly before Germany captured the city. Upon arrival in Delhi, Jehangir's father fell increasingly ill, and Jehangir assumed control of the Tata business empire. Jehangir personally financed counter-insurgency operations in the wake of the break-up of the Raj, and in the process, became increasingly involved in Dominion politics, eventually being appointed as chief of the Indian national bank.
POLITICS_ATUL_CHANDRA_CHATTERJEE_DESC코0=Atul Chandra Chatterjee, diplomat and moderate labor activist, served diligently in the British Raj's 'Indian Civil Service'; he was the British High Commissioner to India when the British Revolution struck, and upended India's political system. His efforts were pivotal to the establishment of the Dominion's foreign service, even personally managing most of his nation's diplomats when issues arose. Following Viceroy Ganga Singh's appointment, Chatterjee became even more prominent in India politics, even striking up a friendship with Singh. Chatterjee has been a vocal advocate of state protection of the rights of India's industrial labourers.
POLITICS_SRINIVASA_SASTRI_DESC코0=Srinivasa Sastri, who founded the Indian Liberal Party after leaving the Indian National Congress, is renowned for negotiating a degree of autonomy for India shortly before the British Revolution. Sastri, though once nearly incarcerated for his association with the Indian Home Rule League, and not opposed to India's recent declaration of a republic, is quite an anglophile; he believes that the institutions established by the British should be maintained.
POLITICS_MINOCHER_MASANI_DESC코0=Minocher Rustom Masani, a vocal proponent of classical liberalism, split with the Indian National Congress due to the Congress's drift towards socialism. Masani is a charismatic and good-natured man, who, despite policy disagreements, maintains personal friendships with many political rivals, even those of the Indian National Congress. Minocher similarly enjoys even the most mundane of political decision, often speaking for hours on end on the floor of parliament on the minutia of financial decisions and administrative budgets. Minocher's attention to detail and gregarious nature has won him a large political following.
POLITICS_NARASIMHA_KELKAR_DESC코0=Narasimha Chintaman Kelkar split with the Indian National Congress due to the Congress's increasingly socialist stance. Shortly before the disintegration of the British Raj, Kelkar, and other more liberal Congress defectors founded the Swaraj (meaning independence or self-governance) Party to promote parliamentarian democracy in India. Kelkar is not only a man of politics, however; he is an accomplished playwright, and his works have been responsible for igniting increased national identity and political consciousness among the people of India.
POLITICS_BALASAHEB_KHER_DESC코0=Balasaheb Gangadhar Kher, and accomplished lawyer, fled Bombay for Delhi in the chaos that followed the dissolution of the British Raj. Kher rose in political prominence by advocating for the protection of the rights of India's lower castes, and it is from these lower caste's that he draws the greatest support. Kher is known for his compassion for the less fortunate outside politics as well; he is known to personally involve himself in charitable endeavours, and is as likely to be found attending to his political duties, as assisting in the construction of a new orphanage or staffing a soup kitchen.
POLITICS_KANAIYALAL_MUNSHI_DESC코0=Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi is an acclaimed author in his native Gujarat; his works cover a broad range of topics, including: law, Gujrati culture, and political theory. Though once a member of the Indian National Congress, Munshi bears a disdain for socialism, and abandoned the Congress due to its leftward drift. Munshi believes that to assure liberty for the people of India and safeguard against the encroachment of insidious socialist influence, property rights must be protected, while the estates of India's landed aristocracy must be broken up.
POLITICS_KRISHNA_MENON_DESC코0=Krishna Menon, often accused of harbouring sympathies for socialism and the Indian National Congress, has nonetheless, become one of India's most prominent political figures. Menon is a masterful manipulator, playing the game of Indian politics much like a grandmaster would play a round of chess. With the death of his political ally, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Menon was forced to step out from the shadows, and become the face of the moderate left in India. Menon is as distrustful of the West as of political rivals, fearing any continued association with the remnants of the British Empire could lead India to ruin.
POLITICS_MUHAMMAD_ALI_JINNAH_DESC코0=Muhammad Ali Jinnah, first entered into politics to promote the interests of India's Muslim minority. Jinnah organised the Lucknow Pact between feuding Muslim and Hindu independence leaders in 1916, and founded the All-India Homerule League during the Weltkrieg to advocate Indian self-determination. Following the Indian National Congress's drift towards socialism, Jinnah split from the congress to form a renewed Homerule League as a formal political party.
POLITICS_SIKANDER_KHAN_DESC코0=Sikander Hayat Khan, Punjabi aristocratic and statesman, and his Unionist Party, have emerged victorious in India's latest presidential election. Khan began his political career as an ally of leftist Muhammad Jinnah, but drifted further from Jinnah with time. He joined the conservative Unionist Party, which had split from the Jinnah's Home Rule Party over dissatisfaction with Jinnah's leadership, and disagreement with the Party's endorsement of land redistribution; this split between Jinnah and Khan has created a political rift amongst Indian Muslims.
POLITICS_CHHOTU_RAM_DESC코0=Chhotu Ram, after helping to found the Unionist Party, withdrew from politics to focus on social work. Ram's work led to a marked increase in the standard of living of some of the most destitute people of Punjab, and the name 'Chhotu Ram' was soon on the lips of a great many Indians. Upon his return to politics, Ram set out to reform the Unionist Party, which had evolved from an alliance of Punjabi Jats and Muslims into an organisation for the protection of the rural nobility of northern India.
POLITICS_MALIK_KHIZAR_TIWANA_DESC코0=Malik Khizar Hayat Tiwana, upon returning from service in the Weltkrieg, became distraught at the division and political violence which had consumed India. Tiwana took up arms against the marauding socialists loyal to the breakaway government in Bengal. Tiwana committed himself in the fragile peace that followed to bring unity to the Indian sub-continent. He joined the conservative Unionist party based in his native Punjab and quickly rose to its leadership.

RAJ_orissa_question코0=Fate of the Zamindar Squatters
RAJ_orissa_question_desc코0=There are a large number of exiled princes who wish to resume their estates in Orissa, now that the socialists have been defeated.

RAJ_assam_question코0=Fate of Assam's Tea Plantations
RAJ_assam_question_desc코0=The vast tea plantations of Assam have functioned as state owned entities until the downfall of their socialist rulers. Now they are suffering, and we must settle the question of what is to be done with them if we are to solidify our rule over the region.

### Events ###
delhi.0.t코0=Introduction to the Dominion of India
delhi.0.d코0=When the Weltkrieg began, no place under the sun of the British empire responded more loyally than India. 'The swords of the martial princes leapt from their scabbards', as one reporter put it. From the trenches of the Western Front to the deserts of Arabia, the troops of the British Raj fought doggedly for its King-Emperor and the glory of battle. However, it was also the expectation of the nascent Indian national movement that their full support for the war effort would in turn translate into political reforms at home, once the war had been concluded. As the Kaiserschlacht concluded, the battles on the Western Front victoriously for the Central Powers, and the campaign in the Middle East turned into a stalemate, Britain and her empire accepted Ludendorff's Peace With Honour in 1919. The defeat did not deter the Indian reform movement, who now loudly demanded Home-Rule to be put in effect. The British response, galvanised by the loss in the Weltkrieg, was draconian. As the British reneged on their promises, the Indian National Congress became further radicalised and sabotage and terror soon became an all too common sight throughout the Raj. When the murder of 41 striking miners in Wales cast the Home Isles into the currents of Revolution, India soon followed suit. Desperately trying to maintain some influence on the sub-continent, the exiled Royalist government in Canada decided to grant India Home-Rule as a Dominion within the Empire under the leadership of Maharaja Ganga Singh of Bikaner. This however did little to calm the resurgent independence movement, and thus when the first elections were held the INC boycotted the ballots. This in turn brought a broad coalition of loyalist parties to power in Delhi which held little legitimacy in Bombay and the Bengal, both centres of nationalist and socialist sentiment. The result was a bloody civil war when the INC declared their own provisional government in Calcutta, soon followed by a cabale of southern nationalist princes united behind the Nizam of Hyderabad. Despite early setbacks, such as an invasion by the Afghans that saw Quetta and Peshawar ceded to Kabul, and defeat in battle, Ganga Singh managed to rally the loyalist forces and defeat the aspirations of both Calcutta and Hyderabad, declaring himself governor-general for life in the process.
delhi.0.a코0=Long Live H.R.H George V! Long Live the Maharaja!

delhi.1.t코0=1936, Delhi's Darkest Hour
delhi.1.d코0=The Delhi government is the self-proclaimed legal successor state to the British Raj, yet within its borders different fractions vie for power. The progressive Rajas and bourgeoisie are content with authoritarian dominion status, but radical nationalists and independence activists are still calling for the expulsion of the British. Tensions are running high inside the Red Fort as well as in the nation's central parliament. To the North, the Afghans watch our every move, while the decadent Southern Princes in their so-called 'Federation' plot our downfall. To the East, the Syndicalist scum of the Bharatiya Commune may well succumb to Totalism, posing another huge threat for our nation. Reform is necessary, otherwise, we will be wiped off the face of the planet, and the British will have failed to rule India just like Alexander, the Mughals, and all others that have come before them.
delhi.1.a코0=Have faith in the Maharaja and the King-Emperor!

delhi.2.t코0=Remnants of the Raj
delhi.2.d코0=A curious mix of princely states and old British colonial administration, Delhi is governed by the Weltkrieg hero Maharaja Ganga Singh and his government of Raj administrators and north-western native princes. However, it has been a decade since revolution threw India into anarchy and it has become painfully obvious that the need for reform is dire.
delhi.2.a코0=For God, Emperor and India!

delhi.3.t코0=The Passing of King George V
delhi.3.d코0=The ousted king of Britain, George V, finally succumbed to the illness that had plagued him since the Revolution swept through the home isles. As the head of state of the Dominion of India, Delhi, his death will certainly cause trouble among the competing fractions of the former Raj, but for now the Chamber of Princes will head a regency until the coronation of his son, Edward.
delhi.3.a코0=The Entente enters a state of mourning.

delhi.4.t코0=Afghanistan Invades!
delhi.4.d코0=Sensing a moment of weakness following the death of George V, Afghanistan has invaded! This is not the first time they have done this, as following the Weltkrieg, they attacked and stole the cities of Peshwar and Quetta. We must protect the Dominion! Jai Hind!
delhi.4.a코0=We will drive back these dogs and reclaim our lands!

delhi.5.t코0=The 5th Anglo-Afghan War: Victory!
delhi.5.d코0=Amanullah Khan's ambition of furthering Afghan influence in India has been crushed. The troops of the Dominion have crossed the Durrand Line, retaken the lost North-West Frontier Provinces and the cities of Peshawar and Quetta, whilst threatening Kabul itself. The Afghan state is in complete disarray and her populace begging for peace. We should at least take back our core provinces, but any further military actions would be politically costly. Setting up a puppet government would work as well, but that would require just as much political capital.
delhi.5.a코0=We should push no further, after all, Afghanistan is the 'Graveyard of Empires'...
delhi.5.b코0=We should set up a puppet government, to ensure the loyalty of the Afghans.
delhi.5.c코0=We must try to pacify the Afghans! When has that ever failed? Onwards to Kabul!

delhi.6.t코0=Who shall rule Afghanistan?
delhi.6.d코0=Now that Afghanistan is firmly within our sphere of influence, we must decide who its ruler will be.
delhi.6.a코0=Let Amanullah Khan keep the throne, the people like him.
delhi.6.b코0=Install Mohmamed Nadir Shah, he will be loyal to us.

delhi.7.t코0=The Imperial Durbar of 1936
delhi.7.d코0=Last held in 1911 in honour of the late George V, the Imperial Durbar was a mass event celebrating the coronation of a new British monarch, as well as a moment for important proclamations regarding the state. Now, with Afghanistan defeated by Indians and the British Empire still in danger, many expect the new monarch, Edward, to have his powers further weakened by an empowered legislature. However, he is still seen as a uniting entity among the disparate ethnic, cultural, and religious groups that make up the subcontinent.
delhi.7.d.nowar코0=Last held in 1911 in honour of the late George V, the Imperial Durbar was a mass event celebrating the coronation of a new British monarch, as well as a moment for important proclamations regarding the state.

delhi.7.a코0=Hail [CAN_king_full_name], King-Emperor of India!
delhi.7.b코0=Hail [CAN_king_full_name], and his Viceroy of India, Maharaja Ganga Singh!

delhi.8.t코0=1936 Dominion Elections
delhi.8.d코0=Now that Afghanistan has been dealt with, and the country secured, King [CAN_king_first_name] has decided to hold elections. Four major parties are competing for the people's votes. The Indian Liberal Party, under V. S. Srinivvasa Sastri, the socially liberal Swaraj Party under Narasimha Kelkar, the socially democratic All-India Home Rule Party under Muhammad Ali Jinnah, and finally the more conservative Unionist party under Sikander Hayat Khan.
delhi.8.a코0=The Indian Liberal Party Wins!
delhi.8.b코0=The Swaraj Party Dominates at the Ballot Box!
delhi.8.c코0=Jinnah's Leftists Sweep the Elections!
delhi.8.e코0=The Unionists remain in power!

delhi.9.t코0=1936 Dominion Elections
delhi.9.d코0=Now that Afghanistan has been dealt with, and the country secured, Viceroy Ganga Singh has decided to hold elections. Four major parties are competing for the people's votes. The Indian Liberal Party, under V. S. Srinivvasa Sastri, the socially liberal Swaraj Party under Narasimha Kelkar, the socially democratic All-India Home Rule Party under Muhammad Ali Jinnah, and finally the more conservative Unionist party under Sikander Hayat Khan.
delhi.9.a코0=The Indian Liberal Party Wins!
delhi.9.b코0=The Swaraj Party Dominates at the Ballot Box!
delhi.9.c코0=Jinnah's Leftists Sweep the Elections!
delhi.9.e코0=The Unionists keep stay in power!

delhi.10.t코0=Status of the Diarchy
delhi.10.d코0=We are faced with an abhorrent number of pressing issues, dormant since the usurpation of Ganga Singh a decade ago. Most urgent is the status of administrative governance which have languished under the ancient relic of the diarchy - dual rule over the provinces shared between the officials of the central government and the domains of the many princely states, bound in subsidiary alliance and vassalage to the head of state. The premier is under great pressure to do away with the archaic system of indirect rule in favour of more efficient and democratic local administration, yet the survival of the Dominion was founded on the loyalty of the north-western princes in a time of great crisis - thus a complete abolition of their privileges might be unwise.
delhi.10.a코0=Let the maharajs play rulers in peace, their loyalty is certain!
delhi.10.b코0=Grant the princes a pension, but abolish their sovereignty!
delhi.10.c코0=Abolish indirect rule and expropriate the princes!

delhi.11.t코0=The Indian Economy Act
delhi.11.d코0=The Indian economy is falling apart. Archaic trade regulations, corrupt tax collectors and abhorrent lack of foreign investment is driving a sword through the neck of economic progress. Calling for a liberalisation of the thriftiness of our nation, the merchants, business magnates and industrialists of the Indus Valley are calling for reform to sweep the economic currents of the Dominion. The Premier is himself not ill-disposed to these ideas which include a broad range of privatisation, tax reforms, and institution of inflation-controlling measures. However, such a strong dose of liberalism might greatly upset the rural poor that still constitute the majority of the Dominion.
delhi.11.a코0=Indian freedom and Indian greatness demand a free market economy!
delhi.11.b코0=An emancipated people needs a balanced economic system!
delhi.11.c코0=Enforce a single market for a single nation!

delhi.12.t코0=The Indian Industry Act [GetYear]
delhi.12.d.liberal코0=In the wake of the our decision to restructure the landscape of Indian economy, calls have arisen from labour activists throughout the Dominion that our government solidify the rights of both the industrial and agrarian workers. Although the factories spanning from Khyber Pass down to Gujarat are relatively scarce, legislation in favour of the workers might serve to stem the tide of Syndicalist influence seeping into the trade unions. However, the backbone of the Liberal Party is founded on the support of business magnates and wealthy industrialists - a group fundamentally opposed to a strong and emancipated worker's movement. The government will have to take a controversial decision no matter what.
delhi.12.d.swaraj코0=Following our decision to restructure the landscape of Indian economy, calls have arisen from labour activists throughout the Dominion that our government solidify the rights of both the industrial and agrarian workers. Although the factories spanning from Khyber Pass down to Gujarat are relatively scarce, legislation in favour of the workers might serve to stem the tide of Syndicalist influence seeping into the trade unions. Yet the Swaraj Party is facing a thoroughly hard choice. On one hand, a great deal of electoral support for the party stems from the emancipated middle class who regard worker's rights positively, but another wing garners considerable financial aid and support from the industrialists and bankers of Delhi and Lahore. With the party thus divided, it seems that only the premier himself will have the power to force through a decision.
delhi.12.d.jinnah코0=Following our decision to restructure the landscape of Indian economy, calls have arisen from labour activists throughout the Dominion that our government solidify the rights of both the industrial and agrarian workers. Although the factories spanning from Khyber Pass down to Gujarat are relatively scarce, legislation in favour of the workers might serve to stem the tide of Syndicalist influence seeping into the trade unions. For Jinnah the course looks clear. Swept into office on the winds of popular affection founded in the lowest levels of society, a refusal to improve the livelihood of the industrial worker will appear as all but traitorous.
delhi.12.d.union코0=Since the Unionist Party swept into office in the last election a reform of the stagnate Indian economy has been passed and the status of the princely states been determined. However, demands have been presented by leaders of the nascent trade union movement of the north-west - demanding the government legislate in favour of greater worker's rights. Traditional and slightly reactionary in its origin, this is a very controversial demand for the incumbent Unionist cabinet. However, the movement for the betterment of worker's rights is an increasingly powerful organisation within the Dominion. As such a contradictory stance by the government and its landed supporters might risk driving the up and coming trade unionists into the arms of radical Syndicalism.
delhi.12.a코0=Trade unionism is nothing short but Syndicalism, restrict it!
delhi.12.b코0=Let us enforce workers' rights moderately, but progressively!
delhi.12.c코0=The proletariat shall no longer suffer, support the trade unions!

delhi.13.t코0=The Bombay Plan
delhi.13.d코0=Now that our opponents have been destroyed, we can turn to returning our industry to civilian purposes. Three plans have been presented, and must be decided upon.
delhi.13.a코0=Have a series of 5 year plans dictate the economy!
delhi.13.b코0=Enact a balanced system where the government can intervene if necessary!
delhi.13.c코0=A free market for a free people!

delhi.21.t코0=The Burmese Question
delhi.21.d코0=A successor state to the late British Raj, Burma's recent history has been troubled. Destabilised by internal friction against the Konbaung dynasty and exploitation of the nascent oil industry, the Burmese have now been freed of the hassle of running their own country by our victorious troops. However, Burma was only a loosely integrated part of the Raj - and some officials within our own government strongly disagree with outright annexing the Burmese districts, instead advocating the creation of a nominal independent Burma - under the benevolent guidance of our own government of course.
delhi.21.a코0=Restore an independent Burma.
delhi.21.b코0=Integrate the Burmese districts into our state.
delhi.21.c코0=Restore the Konbaung dynasty!
delhi.22.t코0=Chaos in [PRF.GetNameDef]!
delhi.22.d코0=Osman Ali Khan's autocratic ambitions and hubris have finally driven the southern princes into open revolt! For the second time in a decade, the Hindu rulers of Mysore and Travancore waver in their oaths of loyalty towards their nominal overlord. Kannada and Malayalam troops already openly engage army units loyal to the Hyderabad government whilst the federal apparatus of state in the south has been thrown into absolute disarray. While it risks provoking the Nizam into war with us, and perhaps [HND.GetNameDef], this could be an opportune time to seize the Bombay Presidency which lies just across our border. Chances are good the Nizam is too busy to respond and will simply let it go.
delhi.22.a코0=Send forces in to occupy Bombay.
delhi.22.b코0=No, this is too risky a plan.
delhi.23.t코0=Dominion Forces Move Into Bombay
delhi.23.d코0=No doubt taking advantage of our chaotic state, soldiers from [RAJ.GetNameDef] have begun streaming across the border into the former Bombay Presidency, fully intending to seize it while we are busy with our civil war. If we attempt to stop them, it will mean open war with the north in addition to our current problems.
delhi.23.a코0=We have no choice but to let them have it.
delhi.23.b코0=We must fight for our territorial integrity!
delhi.24.t코0=Bombay Is Ours
delhi.24.d코0=As we suspected, the [PRF.GetAdjective] forces are too preoccupied to do much more than express outrage at our occupation of Bombay. By the time the war is done, the border will have been solidified.
delhi.24.a코0=A fait accompli!

delhi.25.t코0=War with the British!
delhi.25.d코0=Our war with the British Empire means it is time to cast aside any pretence of allegiance to the British king. We are, after all, no longer a dominion.
delhi.25.a코0=To the new republic!

delhi.100.t코0=The Case of the Princely Armies
delhi.100.d코0=Besides retaining informal sovereignty during the paramountcy of the British Raj, the Princely States also fielded their own private armies, ranging in size from mere regiments to several battalions of infantry, cavalry and artillery. Now, with our new government already having decided on the internal status the Princely remnants, the lingering question of what to do with their armies finally surfaces. Some argue that the Princes retain nominal control over the forces in question while at the same time expanding their ranks in order to keep them up to date with the regular state forces. Others believe it is time to bring the princely troops directly and unequivocally under the control of parliament as equal units to the standard army divisions. At the same time a minority of reactionary maharajas and feudal landowners advocate a maintaining of the status quo, although this approach is highly unpopular.
delhi.100.a코0=Assimilate the princely troops under parliament's control!
delhi.100.b코0=Formally integrate the princely armies, but let the princes remain in control of their divisions!
delhi.100.c코0=Maintain the status quo. We don't want to rock the boat now...

delhi.101.t코0=Atrocities in Nepal!
delhi.101.d코0=The Indian minority in Nepal have started riots against the Nepalese throughout the Ganges-Yamuna Basin, with insurgents taking up arms in Dehradun and Gorakhpur. Caused by the recent massacre committed by the Royal Nepalese Army on Indian protesters celebrating the Hindu festival Diwali, their protests are rapidly spiralling into violence. The Indian minority in Nepal demand the government's intervention!
delhi.101.a코0=To war! We must liberate the oppressed!
delhi.101.b코0=Launch covert actions to take control of their government!
delhi.101.c코0=Who cares?

delhi.106.t코0=[From.GetNameDefCap] Demands Our Burmese Districts
delhi.106.d코0=The cursed [From.GetAdjective] government is demanding the return of the Burmese territory we 'pacified' during the Raj's collapse. This is a shameful display of bad manners!
delhi.106.a코0=It's no use fighting over these useless provinces.
delhi.106.b코0=We know of no 'Burmese' districts, this is Siam - one and indivisible!
delhi.106.c코0=Rally our allies to our defence!
delhi.106.e코0=Rally our overlord to our defence!
delhi.107.t코0=[From.GetName] Submits
delhi.107.d코0=The [From.GetAdjective] government has wisely caved to our demands and returned all occupied Burmese territory.
delhi.107.a코0=A wise move.
delhi.108.t코0=Our Demands for [From.GetAdjective] Burma are Refused
delhi.108.d코0=The very reasonable demands presented by our envoy to the [From.GetAdjective] government have been completely rejected! We now have to choose whether or not to force our claims through by military might or suffer a diplomatic defeat both domestically and internationally. The eyes of the entire country are upon our cabinet!
delhi.108.a코0=Then we shall liberate the Malay Peninsula by force!
delhi.108.b코0=Swallow our pride and renege on our claims.
delhi.109.t코0=[demand_country.GetName] Menaces [From.GetNameDef]
delhi.109.d코0=A resurgent [demand_country.GetAdjective] government is pushing for a revision of the border between their Burmese provinces and those of our [From.GetAdjective] allies. This is a difficult situation given the fact that the areas occupied by [From.GetNameDef] were taken by force, but it wouldn't be cricket to abandon our allies in Indochina...
delhi.109.a코0=Declare our solidarity with our allies in Bangkok!
delhi.109.b코0=Pressure the Siamese to cede the disputed districts.
delhi.110.t코0=[From.GetName] Defends [SIA.GetNameDef]
delhi.110.d코0=Curses! The cowardly Siamese have hid under the skirts of their [From.GetAdjective] allies. What we thought to have been a simple revision of an illegal occupation has turned into an international conflict! This might be a bit more than we asked for, but the repercussions of giving up our claims would be disastrous as well.
delhi.110.a코0=Then we shall liberate the Malay Peninsula by force!
delhi.110.b코0=Such a war would only bring chaos to all of Asia...
delhi.111.t코0=[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Betrayed Us!
delhi.111.d코0=The [From.GetAdjective] has sent a message saying they have no intention of defending us from [demand_country.GetNameDef]'s demands, considering we acquired the territory by force to begin with. They sternly suggest we return the Burmese lands as requested.
delhi.111.a코0=Then we shall fight these aggressors on our own!
delhi.111.b코0=Secede the disputed territories.

delhi.115.t코0=Elections for Parliament, [GetYear]
delhi.115.d코0=It has been four years since the last democratic elections took place in our fair state. From the mouth of the Indus to the peaks of the Himalayas our trusted officials and commissioners are busy erecting voting booths for the millions of honest Indians that certainly will do their democratic duty and participate in the election. Campaigns have been fought and speeches held and the parties of democratic India eagerly await the results.
delhi.115.a코0=The Indian Liberal Party scores a landslide!
delhi.115.b코0=The Swaraj Party carries the day!
delhi.115.c코0=The leftist Home Rule Party sweeps into parliament!
delhi.115.e코0=The farmer-gentry alliance of the Unionist Party triumphs!
delhi.115.f코0=The Socialist Party of India achieves power!

delhi.150.t코0=Death of Sir Sikander Hayat Khan
delhi.150.d코0=One of the greatest statesmen of India, Sir Sikander Hayat Khan, passed away last night at his home in Multan, the Punjab. A great leader and politician, Hayat Khan had led the Unionist Party for several years and campaigned vigorously for the conservative ideals of his party. He is succeeded as chairman by the popular Jat leader, Sir Chhotu Ram.
delhi.150.a코0=Fare thee well.
delhi.151.t코0=Death of V. S. Srinivasa Sastri
delhi.151.d코0=The astute and brilliant leader of the popular Indian Liberal Party, V. S. Srinivasa Sastri passed away late last night after a prolonged period of illness surrounded by his close kin and friends. He is succeeded as leader of the Liberal Party by the young economist Minocher Rustom Masani.
delhi.151.a코0=The Liberal Party mourns its greatest leader.
delhi.152.t코0=The Passing of Ganga Singh
delhi.152.d코0=Maybe the greatest Indian to have lived since the birth of the Raj, Maharaja Ganga Singh passed away at his royal palace in Bikaner State late last night. Having led a distinguished career within the British and Indian armies, Singh was the man who forged a stable legal government in the mad current of socialist rebellion and princely treachery. Now, with India stronger than ever, his place will be incredibly hard to fill.
delhi.152.a코0=The people of India enters a state of mourning.
delhi.152.b코0=J.R.D. Tata, the brilliant magnate, succeeds him as Viceroy.
delhi.152.c코0=A.C. Chatterjee, the stern diplomat, succeeds him as Viceroy.
delhi.153.t코0=Death of Sayajirao Gaekwad III of Baroda
delhi.153.d코0=An imposing and resolute ruler, Sayajirao Gaekwad passed away this morning in his palace in Baroda. Mourned by many, Sayajirao was an independent-minded ruler with little regard for the British or their Raj. He is succeeded by his grandson and famous spend-thrift Pratap Singh Gaekwad who is known to share his grandfather's nationalist sentiments.
delhi.153.a코0=Fare thee well.
delhi.154.t코0=The Passing of Muhammad Ali Jinnah
delhi.154.d코0=Perhaps the greatest politician of modern India and a tireless believer in Indian unity and constitutional politics, Muhammad Ali Jinnah passed away quietly in his sleep last night. A towering personality, Jinnah had shaped the Delhi government since its inception and safeguarded Indian democracy in the face of Syndicalism and princely feudalism. He is succeeded as head of the Home Rule Party by V.K. Krishna Menon.
delhi.154.a코0=The greatest Indian gentleman is no more.
delhi.155.t코0=Death of Khengarji III of Kutch
delhi.155.d코0=A progressive and venerable prince, Khengarji III of Cutch passed away this evening at his residence in Bhuj, Gujarat. Having ruled his state wisely for 67 years, the late prince will be mourned by many.
delhi.155.a코0=Fare thee well.
delhi.156.t코0=Passing of Sir Mian Fazl-i-Husain
delhi.156.d코0=The architect of the gentry/peasant (kisan) political alliance that laid the groundwork for the powerful Unionist Party, Sir Mian Fazl-i-Husain has passed away after a prolonged period of illness. Having been absent from the day to day running of the party for a prolonged period of time owing to his illness, Fazl-i-Husain will never the less be sorely missed within conservative circles.
delhi.156.a코0=The Unionist Party soldiers on!
delhi.157.t코0=Passing of Bhupinder Singh of Patiala
delhi.157.d코0=The much beloved and progressive ruler of the princely state of Patiala in the Punjab, Maharaja Bhupinder Singh, passed away yesterday, surrounded by his family. A veteran of the Weltkrieg, Bhupinder Singh was a close friend and comrade of Ganga Singh of Bikaner. He is succeeded as maharaja by his eldest son, Yadavindra Singh.
delhi.157.a코0=What a tragic event!
delhi.160.t코0=Canada Selling its Old Ships
delhi.160.d코0=While many of the ships we've purchased from the British Navy are too old or in too poor a condition to serve as functioning war vessels, they can still add to our naval transport fleet... and we suspect there are a few ships that are still seaworthy yet. It's a good deal, and one which will help us dominate the Indian Ocean.
delhi.160.a코0=Let's see what we have...
delhi.161.t코0=Rearming of the Royal Indian Marine
delhi.161.d코0=As trade between the newly unified Indian subcontinent and the rest of the world begins to accelerate, the security of Indian shipping has become a most urgent matter. The current state of the Royal Indian Marine leaves much to be desired both in regards to the vessels employed as well as the training of the few capable officers serving. However, the Empire at large has a proud naval tradition and both the Canadian and Australasian shipyards and naval colleges provide the Atlantic and Pacific theatres of operation with powerful fleets where imperial power can be projected. Consequently the naval chief of staff and admiralty in Karachi have petitioned the prime minister with pleas to secure development aid from our allies so that Indian commerce can penetrate the high seas adequately escorted.
delhi.161.a코0=We need a strong navy to secure commerce and liberty!
delhi.162.t코0=Aiding the New Indian Navy
delhi.162.d코0=With cross-Empire trade picking up, the Indian government has decided to expand its naval assets to help protect the increased shipping. The Indian ambassador to [Root.GetNameDef] has approached our government with a request for development aid regarding both engineers and naval officers. This could be a great way of strengthening the Empire's position in the Far East!
delhi.162.a코0=Dispatch technical and development assistance!
delhi.162.b코0=They're on their own.
delhi.163.t코0=Arrival of the [From.GetAdjective] Naval Mission
delhi.163.d코0=After a vigorous sea journey the [From.GetAdjective] naval attaches and ship construction experts have debarked in Karachi. Should we set them up in Karachi itself or maybe expand the existing civilian naval hub in Bombay?
delhi.163.d.aust코0=The naval delegates from the [From.GetAdjective] government have just arrived in Bombay. With their great experience of conducting operations in the Pacific the new Indian navy shall become a truly imposing sight on the high seas!
delhi.163.a코0=Use them to expand the Karachi naval base!
delhi.163.b코0=Set them up in Bombay, the beating heart of Indian commerce!
delhi.163.c코0=We should name a ship HMIS Bruce!

delhi.200.t코0=The Long Night of The Festival of Lights
delhi.200.d코0=In the late hours of the grand Hindu festival of Diwali - the Festival of Lights - riots broke out in Dehradun. Hundreds upon hundreds of celebrating Indians utilised the gathering to launch spontaneous demonstrations against our governance of the region. Nepali shops were burned and the stationed garrisons came under siege. In the chaos of the flames, the governor of the city panicked and ordered the nervous police troops to open fire on a gathering around the Ghanta Gar, leaving around 50 civilians dead, riddled with bullets. As a result, the underground wing of the Indian National Congress has called strikes throughout Uttarakhand, reaching revolutionary heights in the east. From Delhi, Hyderabad and Calcutta feelings are running high as notables engaged in demagoguery call for Indian intervention in a lawful Indian land. It appears that his majesty, Tribhuvan Shah might better watch out.
delhi.200.a코0=This will be a warning heard throughout India!
delhi.201.t코0=The Barricades Go Up in Dehradun
delhi.201.d코0=Riots against the Nepalese occupiers are breaking out throughout Uttarakhand, with insurgents taking up arms in the city of Dehradun. Caused by the recent massacre committed by the Royal Nepalese Army on Indian protests celebrating the Hindu festival Diwali, these upheavals are proof that King Tribhuvan's claim to the mantle of protector of his Indian subjects is shallow and hollow. However, the protesters are poorly armed and inexperienced, making their stand against the well trained and battle hardened Nepali gurkhas as frightening perspective. Conservatives and liberals stand united in this issue - no more Indians murdered by foreign troops! No longer can the Nepalese oppression and occupation of Uttarakhand be tolerated! Parliament is demanding that the government move to the aid of our endangered countrymen, no matter the cost.
delhi.201.a코0=Issue a proclamation, the Nepali army must be withdrawn!
delhi.201.b코0=Dehradun calls and we answer, to war! Jai Hind!
delhi.201.c코0=Why support such Bolshevik rabble?
delhi.202.t코0=[From.GetAdjective] Troops Amass at Dehradun
delhi.202.d코0=In a catastrophic turn of events, the Delhi government has announced its intention to aid the insurgents if our forces continue their repression of the rioters in Dehradun. The hawks within court argue that any concession might endanger the monarchy, however, refusing them outright might spell an even more certain doom on our monarchy's rule in Kathmandu. Today is truly a dark day for Nepal.
delhi.202.a코0=In face of such odds the army can do nothing, withdraw!
delhi.202.b코0=We beat them once and we shall do so again!
delhi.203.t코0=Uttarakhand Secedes from Nepal
delhi.203.d코0=With the withdrawal of our armed forces from Uttarakhand, Indian insurgents and rabble rousers have had a free hand organising themselves, watchfully protected by the bayonets of the Indian army. Consequently, the most prominent agitators have organised a referendum aimed at restoring our southern provinces to Indian suzerainty. After the catastrophe of the Diwali Massacre and subsequent military intervention there seems to be no doubt as to the outcome of such a referendum...
delhi.203.a코0=Popular will backed by foreign weaponry is a hard nut to crack...
delhi.204.t코0=The Secession of Uttarakhand
delhi.204.d코0=Our unification of the Indian subcontinent has come one step closer to reality. Today, the provisional government councils in the district of Dehradun has unanimously voted to apply for annexation into our union. Nationalist banners adorn the streets from the Kashmir Valley to the snowy tops of the Vindhya Range and the people amass at great rallies celebrating this great victory over dastardly foreign influence. However, given the invasion of troops loyal to the Calcutta government the people have become divided - a setback certainly to be overcome in the time to come.
delhi.204.a코0=Jai Hind!
delhi.205.t코0=Tribhuvan's Tryst With Destiny
delhi.205.d코0=In the West, Dominion forces are preparing to come to the aid of the rioting protesters in Dehradun, who have risen in response to a massacre orchestrated by the occupying police garrison. Nepalese army formations are deemed completely impotent in the face of such a modern foe and our intelligence detail among the underground local wing of the INC states that plans of open revolt are hatching in the East as well. A partition of the Nepalese occupied territories thus seems all but imminent. It seems that it will come easily with a dose of proletarian intimidation.
delhi.205.a코0=The Indian Red Army shall sweep into Darjeeling!
delhi.205.b코0=Yak herders mean nothing to the revolution!
delhi.206.t코0=The Red Army on the Move
delhi.206.d코0=Just as we thought things couldn't get worse, our garrisons in Darjeeling report a great amount of troop movement on the border to the East. Undoubtedly a sign that the Bolshevik rabble in Calcutta aims at taken back the territories lost during the Indian Civil War. Sadly, it seems that we are all but powerless in the face of the prospect of a two-front war.
delhi.206.a코0=Surrender the eastern occupied lowlands.
delhi.206.b코0=We shall cleanse the East of Socialist demagogues!
delhi.207.t코0=Nepal Caves!
delhi.207.d코0=With our army gathering on their border, the [From.GetAdjective] government has caved to pressure and surrendered Sikkim and Darjeeling to our control.
delhi.207.a코0=And not a single shot fired!
delhi.208.t코0=Nepali Atrocities in Uttarakhand
delhi.208.d코0=Horrible news has reached us from Uttarakhand! Late last night, the celebration of the Hindu festival of Diwali turned violent as hundreds upon hundreds of Indians utilised the gathering to launch spontaneous protests against Nepal's occupation of rightful Indian soil. A local police commander lost his nerve and ordered his troops to fire upon one of these demonstrations, leaving 50 civilians dead. Tempers are running high throughout the lowlands, reaching revolutionary heights in Dehradun. Our government should be prepared for any eventuality. After all, do we not claim to represent ALL Indians?
delhi.208.a코0=Outrageous!

delhi.300.t코0=The Fate of Princely India's Officer Corps
delhi.300.d코0=Although defeated in the field, the officer corps of Princely India proved its worth on several occasions against our troops. With Hyderabad occupied and the territories of the former Raj almost unified, these men, true patriots, are longing to resume their service to India. However, a great deal of our loyal commanders fear the consequences of so readily accepting former enemies into the army.
delhi.300.a코0=We need all of them to make India mighty once again.
delhi.300.b코0=These men are beyond redemption, lock them away for ever!
delhi.301.t코0=The Fate of Socialist India's Officer Corps
delhi.301.d코0=The Syndicalist threat on the subcontinent has been crushed under the caterpillar tracks of our armoured vehicles. However, some of the commanders who once owed their loyalty to the Calcutta government are willing to give up their political perversions in order to serve Mother India once more. The issue is a dangerous one, given the unforgiving hatred once shared between our two states, and many of our loyal officers deeply resent serving with former enemies.
delhi.301.a코0=Let the least politically tainted officers have a commission.
delhi.301.b코0=These men are beyond redemption, lock them away for ever!
delhi.302.t코0=Integration in the Former Bombay Presidency
delhi.302.d코0=We have brought about the complete collapse of the princely state and established control over the southern-most part of the sub-continent. Now, however, we must decide how to integrate the provinces previously ailing under feudal rule. Should we swiftly and harshly replace the apparatus of governance with our own or gradually implement societal changes, making transition easier for the local elites?
delhi.302.a코0=Take a moderate approach to integration.
delhi.302.b코0=Commence integration immediately and harshly!
delhi.303.t코0=Integration in the Deccan Princely States
delhi.303.d코0=The southern princely states were always somewhat politically detached from the federal government in Hyderabad. This makes it harder for us to establish an efficient central administration. Never the less, that is what we will have to achieve.
delhi.303.a코0=Take a moderate approach to integration.
delhi.303.b코0=We must be firm with these southern princelings!
delhi.304.t코0=Control Asserted in [new_core.GetName]
delhi.304.d코0=While it has been difficult to wean the locals away from their serfdom and dependence on princely landlords, the state of [new_core.GetName] has been assimilated can finally be called a true part of [Root.GetNameDef]!
delhi.304.a코0=It's about time!
delhi.305.t코0=Resistance in [damage_state.GetName]!
delhi.305.d코0=Protests in the formerly princely state of [damage_state.GetName] have grown increasingly violent as of late, spurred on by what we believe to be a reactionary resistance group operating out of remote regions in the hinterlands. Multiple terrorist bombings have accompanied the protests, and will likely continue until we fully assert control over [damage_state.GetName]'s people.
delhi.305.a코0=No doubt funded with princely wealth...
delhi.306.t코0=The Massed Industries of the Bengal
delhi.306.d코0=The Bengal was one of the most populous and prosperous of the Raj's many provinces. Heavily industrialised by Indian standards, the Bengal was also one of the first of Britain's Indian possessions to be heavily affected by socialist unrest. When the Raj collapsed, the Bengal proved a willing base of operations for Bose's campaign against Delhi and Hyderabad. In the ten years passing between the civil war and our conquest of the Calcutta Government, the massive industrial complexes of the Bengal have been expanded with help from the Union of Britain and a delicate bureaucracy of socialist administration put in place. Now these industrial behemoths lie in ruins after our troops swept through the province and different proposals have been presented as to how they can be brought back into shape. However, these industries proved a vital part in the social organisation of the Bengal and a rapid restructure might harm our claim to legal rule.
delhi.306.a코0=The free market shall eradicate Syndicalism in the Bengal!
delhi.306.b코0=Initiate privatisation, but guarantee workers' rights.
delhi.306.c코0=Keep these factories open and working for India!
delhi.307.t코0=Assam's Nationalised Tea Plantations
delhi.307.d코0=Some of the largest industries in all of India, the vast tea plantations of Assam have functioned as staggering state-owned entities until the downfall of Bolshevism in India. Now, the plantations are suffering under the strains of war and poor administration - resulting in poor production rates and massive dissatisfaction amongst the workers. It is our duty as a new legitimate government to address these issues and secure the support and loyalty of the workers in Assam - and maybe earn a little extra while doing so.
delhi.307.a코0=Sell the plantations to the highest (private) bidder!
delhi.307.b코0=Initiate privatisation, but guarantee workers' rights.
delhi.307.c코0=Maintain state control, we need that tea!
delhi.308.t코0=The Princely Émigrés of Orissa
delhi.308.d코0=One of the Eastern provinces seized by the rebels in Calcutta in the chaotic days of the Raj, Orissa was at the time of the Bolshevik conquest characterised by the large numbers of native princely states. Although these petty rulers never rivalled Hyderabad or Kashmir in power, the Calcutta government was quick to expropriate and prosecute the zamindars and rajas of the province. Quite a few of these royal émigrés sought refuge in Delhi, hoping one day to return to their estates and palaces. With the arrival of our troops in Orissa, that wish has now come true. However, a decade of socialist management has collectivised and divided a great deal of the émigrés' estates with huge amounts of peasants and workers depending on the land to survive. The reactionaries within our state crave vengeance and a forceful return to the way of the 'Ancien Regime' whilst the moderates counsel restraint and compromise.
delhi.308.a코0=Disperse the squatters! Return the land to the zamindars.
delhi.308.b코0=Allow the ryats to retain the land and pay off the princes.
delhi.309.t코0=Control Asserted in [new_core.GetName]
delhi.309.d코0=While it has been difficult to wean the locals away from their socialist beliefs and their former reliance on collectivised industry and agriculture, the state of [new_core.GetName] can finally be called a true part of [Root.GetNameDef]!
delhi.309.a코0=It's about time!
delhi.310.t코0=Resistance in [damage_state.GetName]!
delhi.310.d코0=Protests in the formerly-syndicalist state of [damage_state.GetName] have grown increasingly violent as of late, spurred on by what we believe to be a resistance group operating out of remote regions in the hinterlands. Multiple terrorist bombings have accompanied the protests, and will likely continue until we fully assert control over [damage_state.GetName]'s people.
delhi.310.a코0=Why can't they see reason?!
delhi.311.t코0=Status of the Former French Colonies
delhi.311.d코0=France had been the only major rival to Britain's colonial ambition on India and despite the latter's ultimate triumph, the French remained entrenched in several small enclaves. With the inclusion of the late Madras Republic's territory we now control the largest of these former French possessions, Pondicherry. It has been suggested that we restore some sort of autonomy to the city as a gesture of goodwill to our French allies, although this could be mistaken for tacit approval of foreign colonialism.
delhi.311.a코0=We can afford our French friends some special rights.
delhi.311.b코0=Merge the concessions into proper Indian states.
delhi.311.c코0=Ban all French institutions and enforce Indian values!
delhi.312.t코0=The Delhi Government Unites India
delhi.312.d코0=Our stalwart allies in Delhi have vanquished their enemies on the sub-continent. We should return the provinces under our control to them.
delhi.312.a코0=Return the provinces.
delhi.312.b코0=I think not.
delhi.313.t코0=Dealing With the Syndicalist Sanctuaries in Burma
delhi.313.d코0=Burma broke away from the Raj in the chaos of 1925, re-establishing the Konbaung dynasty on the throne in Rangoon. Strikes by oil workers and students resulted in a violent revolution culminating in the proclamation of a leftist republic in 1937, heavily influenced by the Calcutta Government. This influence has also meant that a large number of Syndicalists have sought refuge in Burma, where from they continue to wage a deadly guerrilla war on our military and constabulary in Assam as well as in the Bengal. If we wish to completely crush militant Socialism in South-East Asia, we must eliminate the Burmese support for these fanatics - in effect meaning that we must enforce some sort of regime change in Rangoon. However, how to do this is still debated heavily within the cabinet.
delhi.313.a코0=Send in troops to smoke out the Red Army remnants!
delhi.313.b코0=They'll get bored of running around in the jungle eventually...
delhi.314.t코0=Indian Military Operations in Burma!
delhi.314.d코0=Indian troops have crossed the border in order to destroy the bases of the defeated Calcutta Government's Red Army. How should we react?
delhi.314.a코0=How dare they! retaliate in kind!
delhi.314.b코0=The Red Army guerrillas are on their own!
delhi.315.t코0=Anti-Partisan Actions in Burma Succeed
delhi.315.d코0=The lack of active Burmese support has resulted in our troops successfully destroying the training bases of the remaining Red Army units. Better still, Rangoon's inactivity has caused quite a lot of domestic unrest in Burma, which we could utilise to install a more moderate government.
delhi.315.a코0=Use the momentum to support a coup in Rangoon!
delhi.315.b코0=Pull back the troops to Assam.
delhi.316.t코0=Anti-Socialist Coup
delhi.316.d코0=The weakness of our government has provoked a clique of reactionary army officers to attempt a coup.
delhi.316.a코0=It's the Indians meddling again, isn't it?
delhi.317.t코0=Regime Change in Rangoon
delhi.317.d코0=The weakness of the Burmese government has provoked a clique of reactionary army officers to seize the government. Given our tacit support, the new cabinet has expressed interest in a much closer Indo-Burmese cooperation.
delhi.317.a코0=Bring them in under our sphere of influence!
delhi.317.b코0=Establish cordial relations with the new government.
delhi.318.t코0=Anti-Socialist Coup Fails
delhi.318.d코0=An attempted coup by a group of Burmese army officers has been crushed by the incumbent government, despite our tacit support. Since we still have troops present in Western Burma, we could utilise the chaos to forcibly remove the leftist menace from Rangoon.
delhi.318.a코0=Then we must oust the leftist threat by force!
delhi.318.b코0=Too bad.
delhi.325.t코0=The Indian Referendum
delhi.325.d코0=After a month of turbulence, the referendum to approve the Home Rule Party's platform for integrating the states of the former Bharatiya Commune is upon the nation. Approval in [RAJ.GetNameDef] is split, with opposition having coalesced around the traditionalist Unionist party. Those who favour the platform are far more likely to vote in the Mahatma's new Socialist Party of India, a coalition of politicians from across the former Commune, and who enjoy solid support in Bengal to tip the balance in their favour. The most staunch opposition comes from the princely states in the Northwest, so severe that some are threatening to secede even if the platform is ultimately approved.
delhi.325.a코0=We shall see in a few days...
delhi.326.t코0=The Platform is Approved
delhi.326.d.jinnah코0=After an incredibly close election, the platform to integrate the states of the former Commune has been approved. Even more, the Home Rule Party has been re-elected, with most considering this the beginnings of a true dynasty for the party.
delhi.326.d.socialist코0=After an incredibly close election, the platform to integrate the states of the former Commune has been approved. While it has alarmed many, the Socialist Party has also been elected - mainly due to the overwhelming support for the Mahatma's ideals in the former Commune, but the party earned strong support throughout the entire Ganges region as well. It appears that the nation has moved even further to the left, though the Socialist leaders affirm they will uphold the Lucknow deal and not attempt to turn the nation towards syndicalism.
delhi.326.a코0=Well, that's a relief!
delhi.327.t코0=The Platform Fails
delhi.327.d코0=After an incredibly close election, the platform to integrate the states of the former Commune has failed and the Unionist Party has a mandate to take power until the next regular election. Where this leaves the former Commune is difficult to say, though army units are already moving into Calcutta and other southern cities to keep order should there be an outbreak of violence.
delhi.327.a코0=This could be trouble...
delhi.328.t코0=Kashmir and Gujarat to Secede
delhi.328.d코0=While the Unionist platform didn't receive much support anywhere in the northwest, the princely regions of Gujarat and Kashmir rejected it utterly. Riots have been frequent in the weeks since, and after a report that [RAJ.GetAdjective] soldiers fired on an unruly crowd, the princes of Kashmir and Baroda have announced their intentions to secede and join [PRF.GetNameDef]. If we do not allow them to leave, the riots may get worse, and it could very well mean immediate war with the south.
delhi.328.a코0=It would be better to let them go, for now.
delhi.328.b코0=Absolutely not!
delhi.329.t코0=Kashmir and Gujarat Join the Federation
delhi.329.d코0=Having resoundingly rejected the northern plan to peacefully integrate socialists, the princely rulers of Kashmir and Gujarat have offered to join the Federation and take a stand against the foolish leftists of [RAJ.GetNameDef].
delhi.329.a코0=Welcome aboard!
delhi.330.t코0=A Call For Help
delhi.330.d코0=Having resoundingly rejected the northern plan to peacefully integrate socialists, the princely rulers of Kashmir and Gujarat announced their intention to secede and join [PRF.GetNameDef]... but, of course, they have been refused and [RAJ.GetAdjective] soldiers are streaming into their provinces. Their rulers have reached out to us for help, saying they are fully willing to rise up and fight the socialists now, if we will only follow suit.
delhi.330.a코0=Rush to the aid of the princes!
delhi.330.b코0=They are on their own - sorry.
delhi.331.t코0=Nehru Takes Over the Socialists
delhi.331.d코0=With Gandhi now a memory, the young Jawaharlal Nehru - a prominent syndicalist leader from the former Bharatiya Commune who joined the socialist coalition upon union - has out-manoeuvred Nirmal Kumar Bose to take the leadership of the Socialist Party. Bose, claiming to be completely blindsided by Nehru's actions, has elected to retire from politics.
delhi.331.a코0=An ambitious man.
delhi.332.t코0=AI Bounce Event
delhi.332.d코0=*** This is for the AI only ***
