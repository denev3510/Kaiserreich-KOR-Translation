### Leaders ###
POLITICS_ARTUR_NEIVA_BAH_DESC코0=Artur Neiva is an extremely renowned and respected scientist, whose forays into politics are fairly recent, being appointed to administrative positions in the Bahian government of the early 1930s in the wake of the interstate war. While his experience in political matters is mostly practical in terms of bureaucracy, he is known worldwide for his studies and scientific expeditions in the US, Argentina and the hinterlands of Bahia and other brazilian states, which helps with the international standing of the newly founded republic, seeking to improve its situation through proven science rather than poorly planned idealism. He shares many political beliefs with Monteiro Lobato, and while some call out the eagerness of the pair to work with foreign powers, they believe they do what must be done for the advancement and development of their new nations.
POLITICS_A_BAH_DESC코0=Luís Viana Filho hails from Salvador da Bahia, but was actually born in Paris. Having, like most politicians in his state, graduated in law school, he shifted his career towards journalism, working for multiple important newspapers in the area. Elected a representative in the 1930s, his career has steadily increased his clout, and he managed to place himself in a position to present himself as the leader of a stable, independent Bahia to the occupiers who then held Salvador. A man believing in aggressive and decisive action in politics, Luis plans to push an intense industrialisation program in the newly independent republic.
POLITICS_VITAL_BAH_DESC코0=Born before the time of the republic in 1874, Vital Soares is a well known liberal lawyer and politician hailing from the state of Bahia, just one of many prominent figures that followed the power vacuum that local oligarch JJ Seabra left in the state political landscape. While previously a staunch ally of Julio Prestes and one of the main figures of the Liberal Party, Vital joined the splinter Liberal Republican movement following frustration with the compromises made with the party's ideals, but his career certainly has taken an expected turn, as he is now at the helm of the first independent Bahian state in history. While his principles will certainly not waver easily, his position at the helm of what essentially is a puppet state is not an enviable one, especially since the new independence has not erased the old rivalries that have torn Bahia for decades.
POLITICS_BALEIA_BAH_DESC코0=Aliomar de Andrade Baleeiro is a native of Salvador da Bahia, where he was born and raised, and graduated from university in 1921 with a degree in law, as is all too common in Bahian politics. Having worked on several different newspapers before starting his political career, he acted as both a state and federal representative in the old political order, never having reached the heights he seeked. Now, with the status quo completely destroyed by the conflict that ended Brazil, Aliomar has positioned himself not only to be the first president of an independent and free Bahia, but also to curtail the clout of many of his long standing political opponents while increasing his own. Many believe that this is but the first step towards the beginning of a brand new political dynasty in Bahia.
POLITICS_JURACY_BAH_DESC코0=A respected military man, Juracy gained notoriety by his fast rise in state politics in Bahia. However, the rise of such a notable outsider can usually be explained by loss of popularity and legitimacy by political leadership, and in the case of Bahia, it was the fall from grace of the oligarch JJ Seabra. Now at the helm of Bahia yet again, a fact no doubt consequential of his immense political clout on the region, but now as a sovereign state, he looks to both improve the economical situation and improve diplomatic ties with non hostile regimes to ensure better trading partners in these chaotic times.
POLITICS_GRABOIS_BAH_DESC코0=Maurício Grabois, born in Salvador da Bahia in 1912, is descended from bessarabian jews that fled the ever growing chaos of the Russian Empire during the Russo-Japanese war to find a new life in Brazil, after a long journey. While studying at a military school, he started to lean towards radical leftism, while also becoming a staunch opposition of the ever growing integralist ideology that seemed to spread into barracks across the country then. While just 24 years old, he already was leading syndical and socialist activities, and his early rise only went further within the labour cause. After so much and war and destruction, it'd be easy to lose hope, but Mauricio sees the newfound independence of Bahia as an unparalleled opportunity for the country to truly leave its past of poverty and oligarchy behind in the dust of history. However, such things are far easier planned than done, as even with military support of the occupiers, dislodging the extremely powerful coroneis from their positions of power held for centuries may be a violent and costly endeavour for all parties involved.
POLITICS_MARIGHELLA_BAH_DESC코0=Carlos Marighella is from Salvador, hailing from a poor family of italian father and hausa mother. Born in 1911, he was a talented student, notorious in his school for his skills with verse and prose alike, but he soon turned into politics, becoming involved in the constant confrontations that occurred between syndicalists and integralists in downtown Salvador. While he was arrested a few times, he did manage to be elected a representative in 1936, albeit that was a relatively short lived state of affairs, as he grew frustrated with his inability to actually make a difference in the station. This certainly is not the case as head of state in Bahia, where he has received support from many of his former Brazilian comrades to step up and lead the newly established commune to prosperity and socialism. However, his already old enemies in the oligarchic families of the state must be dealt with before any of these dreams can be realised.
POLITICS_JORGE_AMADO_BAH_DESC코0=Jorge Leal Amado de Faria was born in Itabuna in 1912, and began his career as an author as early as age fourteen. He moved on to Rio de Janeiro to conclude his studies of law, and there was influenced by the many left wing intellectuals and the ideas of the revolutions in Europe, whose success seemed to inspire the left wing elites of the country. He later became a journalist, and only truly joined the political arena in the years after the tumultuous 1936 elections. While he officially defines himself as irreligious, he is in practice a practitioner of Candomblé, an african traditional faith that has many practitioners in the state of Bahia, and is well acquainted with most religious leaders in his home region. Now thrust into the position of head of state, many question his relative lack of experience in the political arena when compared to other candidates for the task, a concern clearly not shared by the majority of representatives, evidently. While his enthusiastic approach to his new job is certainly for many welcome, he may well not be prepared for the great task of ensuring the cooperation of the disparate unions and factions in the nation.
POLITICS_MAMEDE_BAH_DESC코0=Jurandir de Bizarria Mamede was born in Salvador in the year 1906, and from an early age prepared for a military career, gaining minor positions in the local infantry regiment by 1927; and such, he is a veteran officer of the interstate war. He then was transferred to several garrison and military police commands, always serving with distinction and climbing the ranks of the military by his own merits. While many defeated officers have chosen to shy away from public duty after the devastating that so recently ended, Jurandi has chosen to embark into the political arena, as he sees himself in the best position to re-establish the rule of law and order to the newly established Republic of Bahia. He takes a particular dislike of syndicalists, and this distance is by no means secret and quite a few of these politicians have pre-emptively left Bahia before he can decisively move against these traitors.
