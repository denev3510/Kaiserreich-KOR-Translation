### Foreign Policy
OTT_Invite_Istanbul_Pact코0=Invite [FROM.GetName] to the Istanbul Pact
OTT_Invite_AMN코0=Invite [FROM.GetName] to the Association of Muslim Nations
OTT_war_for_thrace코0=War for Thrace
OTT_war_for_thrace_desc코0=Inhabited by a Turkish Muslim majority, the lands of Western Thrace were taken from us after the disastrous Balkan War. Repeated reports of mistreatment of these people by the Bulgarian government and the rising anti-Bulgarian sentiment in the Balkans overall are now putting pressure on the Ottoman government to interfere in favour of these Turks and to return them to the protection of the Porte.

### AMN
OTT_AMN_Category코0=The Association of Muslim Nations
OTT_AMN_Category_desc코0=An international organisation to foster and strengthen the ties between the various nations following the Islamic faith, the Association of Muslim Nations is an Ottoman initiative and consists of diplomatic, economic, social and cultural sub-organisations.

### Cairo Pact War
Ottoman_Cairo_Pact_decisions코0=Middle Eastern Campaign
Ottoman_Cairo_Pact_decisions_desc코0=Beset from all sides and betrayed by those who we believed to be our staunchest allies, we must now fight for everything that we hold dear. Let us remember those who repelled the British forces at Maraş and let us honour the heroes of Antep as we now face yet another threat to our great nation! For the Sultan and the house of Osman!

OTT_Varlik_Vergisi코0=Enact the Varlık Vergisi
OTT_Varlik_Vergisi_desc코0=The 'Varlık Vergisi' is a specific war tax which targets rich Armenians and Jews to fund the operations of the government. By putting exorbitant burdens on these groups, the policy both serves to remedy the ever-increasing deficit and to bolster the 'National Economy' by pushing the non-Muslims out of business and encourage take-overs by Turkish citizens.

### Suez Reparation
Suez_Reparation_decisions코0=The Suez Canal
Suez_Reparation_decisions_desc코0=War has ravaged the vital lifeline of empires and enterprises, leaving its narrow track filled with debris of sunken vessels, crashed airplanes and deliberate sabotage attempts by both sides. With the M.O.J. abolished, the question of the future of the Suez returns once more to the forefront. Uncertainty remains with regard to the identity of the future guardians of the Canal, even as in the Suez Zone itself, companies are awaiting funds to clear the Suez blockade.\n\nAll nations who have accepted the §YPort Said Convention§! receive access to the §YReparation Effort§! decisions which contribute to a shared timer.

Axis_Suez_Strait_Convention_OTT코0=Organise the Port Said Straits Convention
Axis_Suez_Strait_Convention_OTT_desc코0=With war both in Europe and other parts of the globe either in full swing or approaching quickly, we can no longer be hesitant about the status of the Suez Canal. There is an immediate need for a binding resolution ratified by all parties involved to decide its future.
Axis_Suez_Commence_Reparations_OTT코0=Commence Reparations of the Canal
Axis_Suez_Commence_Reparations_OTT_desc코0=The last signatures have been placed on the official documents and the various diplomats are once more returning home. For us however, the real work is only about to start as the extensive damage caused to the Canal and its facilities during the war will take many resources and time to heal.
Axis_Suez_Reparations_small_effort코0=Small Reparation Effort
Axis_Suez_Reparations_small_effort_desc코0=Although primarily an Ottoman operation, the reparation of the Suez Canal and its surrounding facilities has attracted great attention from companies and investors all across the world who see in the ruined Canal a golden opportunity for endless profit. Governments on the other hand see it both as a strategic tool for their supply lines but also as a propaganda tool showcasing the unity of the anti-socialist bloc and the power of international cooperation.
Axis_Suez_Reparations_large_effort코0=Large Reparation Effort
Axis_Suez_Reparations_large_effort_desc코0=Although primarily an Ottoman operation, the reparation of the Suez Canal and its surrounding facilities has attracted great attention from companies and investors all across the world who see in the ruined Canal a golden opportunity for endless profit. Governments on the other hand see it both as a strategic tool for their supply lines but also as a propaganda tool showcasing the unity of the anti-socialist bloc and the power of international cooperation.
Axis_Suez_Reparations_mission코0=Suez Reparation Works
Axis_Suez_Reparations_mission_desc코0=Although primarily an Ottoman operation, the reparation of the Suez Canal and its surrounding facilities has attracted great attention from companies and investors all across the world who see in the ruined Canal a golden opportunity for endless profit. Governments on the other hand see it both as a strategic tool for their supply lines but also as a propaganda tool showcasing the unity of the anti-socialist bloc and the power of international cooperation.

### Syrian Integration
OTT_Handling_Suriye코0=Centralisation of the Syrian Lands
OTT_Handling_Suriye_desc코0=§YIntegration of Syrian Vilayets§! : §G[?OTT.syr_integration_factor]%§!\n\n(When §YIntegration of Syrian Vilayets§! reaches §G50%§!, the Syrian states can be upgraded to §YVilayet§! status and when it reaches more than §G100%§!, they can be upgraded to §YOttoman Province§! status)\n\nFor more info over the Greater Syria region and its relation to the Porte, hover over the §CQuestion Mark§!.
OTT_Syria_Tooltip_GUI코0=The Vilayets of Syria stretch out from the city of Aleppo in the North to the deserts of Ma'an and serve as the centre point of §RArab Resistance§! to Ottoman authority.\n\nFrom all the Arab holdings in the Empire, Syria was always seen as the most important which was reflected in its relative economic power. It is also the most politically active region in the Mashriq with the centre of §CBeirut§! and §CDamascus§! forming the forefront of developing §RArab nationalism§!. One can however not pinpoint where Anatolia ends and Syria begins as the intricate mingling of population groups has made Greater Syria one of the most diverse regions in the world, forming the home to over a dozen religions and ethnicities. This §YSectarian Tapestry§! has hindered the development of a fully Arab nationalist character and the promotion of a §GRegionalist Character§!. Aleppo, Beirut, Damascus, Homs, etc. all form their own communities with their own goals and ambitions which has led to constant political bickering. This constant fighting between cities and powerful families has in the last few years started to pave the way towards an initial attempt at bringing mass politics and populism to the common people. Successes for now remain limited but the influence from the §RInternationale§! and §RFar-right movements§! on the European continent are flowing through the cosmopolitan city of §CBeirut§!.

OTT_SYR_Abolish_Lebanon코0=Abolish the Mutasarrifate of Mt. Lebanon
OTT_SYR_Abolish_Lebanon_desc코0=For most of its history under Turkic rule, Lebanon was an autonomous emirate governed across the years by Druze clans that pledged loyalty to the Sultan. The favouritism for Druze dynasties in positions of power and granting privileges to Muslim sects soon alienated the vast population of Christians around Mount Lebanon, particularly the Maronites. A series of revolts in the 18th and 19th century culminated in open civil war between Christians and Druze, which transpired simultaneously with the ongoing Tanzimat reforms and the attendant increase in political meddling by Western imperial powers in the Ottoman Empire’s internal affairs. The end result was the Ottomans conceding to European and Maronite demands to grant Christians an autonomous province of their own.\n\nThe First Mutasarrifate of Mount Lebanon did not last long, however. It was notorious for its Byzantine bureaucracy and the overbearing role that foreign powers played in the region’s internal government. When war arrived on Turkish shores in 1915, Djemal Pasha abolished the autonomous status of the region and forced it into his own Syrian fiefdom. For the Lebanese people, the war would become one of the darkest periods in their history, with a famine claiming the lives of over 100,000 citizens and the cedar trees on which the citizens prided themselves being cut down to fuel the Hejaz Railway.\n\nMilitary government would remain the order of the day in Mount Lebanon until 1921, when after heavy international and local pressure the region was restored to Mutasarrifate status. The strong foreign interests of prewar Mount Lebanon would be kept at bay, however, by fierce opposition from the Ottoman government and by further global instability.\n\nNonetheless, this restoration of autonomy was seen as a betrayal of the centralist ideals and with tensions rising in the other Mutasarrifates of Jerusalem, Kibris and Basra, the government sees these regions as obstacles to its reforms.
OTT_SYR_Centralise_Infrastructural_Maintenance코0=Integrate Syrian Railroads into the DDY
OTT_SYR_Centralise_Infrastructural_Maintenance_desc코0=The 'Devlet Demiryolları Umum Müdürlüğü', or State Railways Administration, which was founded during the early twenties and incorporates a vast portion of the Anatolian Railway Network, will be expanded to maintain and extend the Northern Portion of the Hejaz Railway.\n\nTaking over from a wide plethora of smaller companies and foreign concessions, this will greatly increase the efficiency of our targeted railway expansion and will make it easier for Kostantiniyye to exert its authority over the vast territories it governs in the Levant.
OTT_SYR_Settle_Tribes코0=Settle the Southern Syrian Bedouins
OTT_SYR_Settle_Tribes_desc코0=The Southern Syrian lands around the town of Amman have long escaped Ottoman authority and have been neglected by our predecessors. Mainly used as an access point to the far more important Hejaz, our control over the region is limited to the direct area around the Hejaz Railway and certain pilgrim hotspots along the way to Mecca. This has resulted in a large influx of migrants from Syria, Circassia and even Anatolia which have fled from the conscription and taxation of the North.\n\nNonetheless, the region remains dominated by Bedouin tribes who harass both pilgrims and settlers alike refusing to pay their taxes. To solve this issue, the government has embarked on a large scale settling program of our Arab tribes both here and other regions scattered around Syria.
OTT_SYR_Central_Tax_Collection_Agency코0=Centralise Tax Collection (Greater Syria)
OTT_SYR_Central_Tax_Collection_Agency_desc코0=The present structures established within the wider Syrian region have allowed for a wide plethora of sanctioned tax collectors ranging from the Millet level which distinguishes between religion, the Vilayet level which collects a certain amount of taxes based on an approximate geographical location and the city level which collects 'gifts' for the Damascan elite.\n\nAll together this has not only led to great confusion amongst the taxpayers but also outrage as the tax pressure seemingly increases by the day as each level of authority deems itself worthy of more and more income.\n\nTo eradicate this problem, a new plan has been proposed to combine all tax collection within a singular agency located in Beyrut and from there on better regulate the expenses of the local government.
OTT_SYR_Restrict_Arab_Nationalist_Newspapers코0=Restrict Arab Nationalist Newspapers
OTT_SYR_Restrict_Arab_Nationalist_Newspapers_desc코0=Even though the Arab Revolt ended in a complete failure for the Hashemites and the Arab movement in general, the seeds of Ottoman resistance were planted. A new generation of educated youths has taken it upon themselves as their mission to strive for the creation of an Arab state free from Turkish tutelage and have started to use the media to spread their message across the land. Due to our pitiful literacy rate and the immense distances within our Empire, their message hasn't been able to spread very effectively yet as the ordinary man on the fields has not yet shown a tendency to oppose the Sultan.\n\nThe increasing literacy efforts of the central government though are likely to bring change to this so it may be wise to prevent their message from reaching too many people.
OTT_SYR_Turkish_Integration_Resettlement_Program코0=Implement the Turkish Integration Program
OTT_SYR_Turkish_Integration_Resettlement_Program_desc코0=The Northern Vilayets of Syria, especially Halep, have long been closer to the Turkish world than the Arab centre of gravitas located in the Hejaz and Baghdad. Nonetheless the population of these regions is Arab rather than Turkish and their loyalty should a general Arab revolt occur is questionable at best. To remedy this, the government has designed a plan called the Turkish Integration & Resettlement program which plans to increase Turkish migration to these areas by the sale of government land to those that speak the Ottomanish language.\n\nThis move is likely to anger a vast portion of the Arab population and might reignite new revolts but may in the long run serve as a reliable way to ensure the loyalty of the Vilayet.
OTT_SYR_Finish_West_Jordan_Irrigation_Project코0=Finish the West Jordan Irrigation Project
OTT_SYR_Finish_West_Jordan_Irrigation_Project_desc코0=Started during the days of the M.O.J, the aim of the West Jordan Irrigation Project is to prevent periods of drought from hitting the hill country surrounding Jerusalem and as such bolster its agricultural potential. With the population of the so-called 'Holy Land' rapidly increasing, its need for arable land has as well. Cooperating with Ottoman authorities and officials, the main funding and expertise behind the project comes from the local 'Yishuv' or Jewish community.
OTT_SYR_Hunt_Down_Insurgents코0=Persecute Palestinian Insurgents
OTT_SYR_Hunt_Down_Insurgents_desc코0=To secure Jerusalem's and its surrounding Kaza's security, actions must be taken to defeat the roving rebel bands (often composed of deserted Arab or Ottoman troops) that have taken over the countryside. Further complicating this task are the Zionist militias which have grown in size during the conflict, setting themselves up as the first last of defence against invaders targetting their settlements. Of these, the Irgun has proven the most evasive and aggressive with the general leadership of the 'Yishuv' finding themselves incapable of reining them in.\n\nTo counter this threat, the new military governor of Jerusalem has devised a scheme in which extensive gendarmerie units will work in cooperation with the Ottoman army to thoroughly sweep the entire region and restore order.
OTT_SYR_Ensure_Demographic_Balance코0=Regulate Palestinian Immigration
OTT_SYR_Ensure_Demographic_Balance_desc코0=Unregulated Jewish immigration under the auspices of the International Council formed one of the main reasons for the explosion of violence in the region during the year preceding the Ottoman-Egyptian war and remains a complicated debate in the region. Although the Ottoman government had already attempted to regulate the influx of Zionists prior to the Weltkrieg, it now finds itself after decades of mismanagement presented with a fait accompli. Hundreds of thousands of Zionist settlers have found a home in Palestine and with many siding with our government during the war, Kostantiniyye is uninterested in uprooting the Jewish population.\n\nNonetheless, the continued influx from Europe can no longer be tolerated as it would further upset the fragile peace that has only recently been reintroduced by the Porte. Therefore strict immigration restrictions will be placed on Palestine, forbidding the entry of new settlers (who will instead be redirected to other less developed region of the empire) and a deportation order of the so-called "Af Al Pi" immigrants (associated and sanctioned by the Irgun) given. Weakening the influence of this Zionist militia organisation and satisfying the immediate demands of the non-Jewish population, this should ensure stability and order in the region.

### Hejazi Integration
OTT_Handling_Arab_Vilayets코0=Centralisation of the Arab Peninsula
OTT_Handling_Arab_Vilayets_desc코0=§YIntegration of Arab Peninsular Vilayets§! : §G[?OTT.hej_integration_factor]%§!\n\n(When §YIntegration of Arab Peninsular Vilayets§! reaches §G50%§!, the Arab Peninsular states can be upgraded to §YVilayet§! status and when it reaches more than §G100%§!, they can be upgraded to §YOttoman Province§! status)\n\nFor more info over the Hejazi region and its relation to the Porte, hover over the §CQuestion Mark§!.
OTT_Arab_Tooltip_GUI코0=Containing the Holy Cities of Medina and Mecca, the vast deserts of inner Arabia and the coastal cities of Jeddah, Qatar and Bahrain, the Arab peninsula is a patchwork of §YEmirates§! and §YTribal Rivalry§!. Not only is Ottoman authority here minimal at best but in the deserts of the interior, war is being waged between the §CRashidi federation§! of the North and the §CSaudis§! in the South. As the focus on §YCentralisation§! of the state and §YConsolidation§! of currently held territory remains, many in the capital have argued that the Peninsula is a §RLost Cause§!, a §RWaste of Time§! and a §RDrain on Resources§! that we do not have and that it would be better to exploit the rivalry of the tribes to keep their attention away from the Empire than to §ROverextend§! ourselves and risk awakening a §RUnited Resistance§!.\n\nThe same cannot be said over the §YHejaz§! However, where the Cities grant the Caliph his §GLegitimacy§! and where the earnings of the Hajj provide a valuable asset to the state coffers. Nevertheless the failed §CHashemite Revolt§! has left its scars and although the Ottoman army ensures the stability of the region, it is commonly referred to by common soldiers as one of the worst postings in the empire. §RTribal Raids§! are a near constant affair and as the birthplace of the revolt, the region also serves as a rallying point for various §RArab 'Freedom' Fighters§! whose anger against the regime fulminates in armed aggression towards its soldiers. The completion of the Hejaz railway and its expansion during the '20s has drastically increased our authority over the region but outside of urban regions, a web of bribery, intimidation and loose alliances with its local rulers provides a §RShaky Balance§!.

OTT_ARA_Centralise_Tax_Collection코0=Centralise Tax Collection (Hejaz)
OTT_ARA_Centralise_Tax_Collection_desc코0=The Hejaz vilayet has a special status within our Empire as the Holy Cities, the most important cities on the peninsula, and their importance to Islam have kept many of our centralisation policies at bay with even the Young Turks of the CUP unwilling to touch this old institution. This has almost completely exempted the region from taxation and in fact subsidies called 'surre' are even granted from the Ottoman treasury which are distributed to the poor in Mecca and Medina.\n\nOur current Grand Vizier however is far less open to the continued presence of religious authority in matters of the state and has decreed that the region should pay its taxes just like any other vilayet and has ordered an extensive investigation into the region to establish a central agency in Medina.
OTT_ARA_Salination_Plant코0=Expand Desalination Operations
OTT_ARA_Salination_Plant_desc코0=As the population of the Hejazi cities keeps climbing, the water supply is unable to keep up and in various cities along the Red Sea serious issues are starting to arise. Primitive desalination operations were started in the early 20th century but lack of funds and a focus on Anatolia and Mesopotamia has left the old installations in decline. By utilising new breakthroughs in the scientific field, we should now replace and expand the operation and ensure the Hejazi people have secure access to clean potable water.
OTT_ARA_Settle_Tribes코0=Settle the Hejazi Tribes
OTT_ARA_Settle_Tribes_desc코0=Although one of the most 'urban' regions on the peninsula, the Hejaz still suffers from an extreme lack of urbanisation. Outside cities such as Medina, Mecca and Jeddah most of the population is still of a migratory nature which makes conducting population counts, conscription and taxation nigh impossible. The sheer size of the region has made much authority impossible outside of the Hejaz railway but by consolidating the population in designated areas, Kostantiniyye hopes to more effectively exert its influence.
OTT_ARA_Abolish_Sharif코0=Abolish the Meccan Sharifate
OTT_ARA_Abolish_Sharif_desc코0=Dating back to the late Abbasid era, the office of Grand Sharif of Mecca has as task the protection of the Holy Cities and its surrounding territory. During the late 19th century and after the loss of Egypt, the Hejaz was restructured into the Vilayet of Hejaz with an appointed governor or Wāli. Nonetheless the Sharifate was retained which has created a dualist power structure in the region that has endured to this day. Traditionally granted to the Hashemite family, the office came under serious attack when its former tenant Hussein bin Ali Pasha started the Arab revolt. He was replaced by Irade (imperial decree) in 1916 by Alī Haydar Pāshā who remained loyal to the Sultan throughout the war.\n\nNonetheless the Sharif is growing old and a successor will soon need to be appointed by the Sultan. Centralists within the administration see in this the chance to abolish the ancient office once and for all and solve the governing duality of the region but others have warned that tearing down such an old pillar of Islam may cause serious unrest across the entire Islamic world.
OTT_ARA_Expand_Dubai_Air_Base코0=Expand the Dubai Air Base
OTT_ARA_Expand_Dubai_Air_Base_desc코0=Serving as a key strategic base for the Ottoman air force, the Dubai air strip was constructed in 1935 to link Iraq to Muscat and from there on India. With the threat of Iranian aggression ever looming, the air strip was accompanied by a military base home to 500 soldiers of the Ottoman army. The needs of this small army quickly established in Dubai a lively economy and proved to be a great boon to the struggling harbour.\n\nThe advent of oil in the Arab Gulf has complicated matters for the Ottoman state as whilst they were previously content with superficial control over the Gulf, it has become clear that the petroleum industry will prove to be a key aspect of the future Ottoman state and total control over the Gulf an absolute requirement. For that purpose, the order has been given to expand the Dubai base and establish similar operations across the Gulf.
OTT_ARA_Abolish_Trucial_States코0=Abolish the Gulf States
OTT_ARA_Abolish_Trucial_States_desc코0=The Shaykhdoms of the Gulf have long enjoyed a privileged status in the Arab world, maintaining quasi total control over their little fiefdoms without the risk of foreign invasion. When Britain retreated from the Gulf and the Sublime Porte became their new guardian, life continued much as it had before but slowly the foundations were laid for a far closer relation to the Porte than Britain had ever entertained. Now that the importance of the Gulf is becoming clearer by the day, we can no longer risk limited control over its constituents and need to draw decisive lines on the new world map. To this degree the various Shaykhdoms will be abolished, with authority centralised in the new Vilayet of al-Hasa where, headquartered in Hufuf, the Ottoman Governor-Admiral will rule the Gulf. The various Shaykhs will however not immediately be asked to hand over power as even the hardliners realise this would only lead to unrest, war and other unpleasantness. Therefore the various Shaykhdoms will be reorganised into a collection of Kazas and Sanjaks with the Shaykhs appointed as kaymakams where necessary.
OTT_ARA_Crack_Down_Gulf_Smuggling코0=Create the al-Hasa Coast Guard
OTT_ARA_Crack_Down_Gulf_Smuggling_desc코0=Piracy and smuggling have been a major issue in the Gulf for as long as it has been populated and although British naval operations were able to put a halt to the practice, the war in the Levant and India has seen a massive rise in smuggling as the Shaykh of Dubai fully embraced the practice, establishing his city as the smugglers capital of both the Gulf and the Indian Ocean.\n\nIt is clear that this practice cannot continue as whilst it has proven damaging to our foes, it also greatly harms the security of our own shipping in the Gulf and with the rise of the petroleum industry we can no longer sit idly by whilst our precious cargo is captured by 20th century pirates.

OTT_ARA_Military_Mission_to_ARA코0=Send a Military Mission to [FROM.GetName]
OTT_ARA_Military_Mission_to_ARA_desc코0=The military reforms undertaken by our empire have led to awe from our neighbours, whose armies still rely on tribal militias with limited training. These nations have now requested experts from Kostantiniyye to assist them in their modernisation programs, promising great compensation. This could prove risky however as this also increases the strength of these nations with whom we may someday find ourselves at war.

### Greek Integration
OTT_Handling_Greek_Vilayets코0=Centralisation of the Greek Islands
OTT_Handling_Greek_Vilayets_desc코0=§YIntegration of Greek Insular Vilayets§! : §G[?OTT.gre_integration_factor]%§!\n\n(When §YIntegration of Greek Insular Vilayets§! reaches §G50%§!, the Greek Insular states can be upgraded to §YVilayet§! status and when it reaches more than §G100%§!, they can be upgraded to §YOttoman Province§! status)\n\nFor more info over the Greek Islands region and its relation to the Porte, hover over the §CQuestion Mark§!.
OTT_Greek_Tooltip_GUI코0=Serving as the upper middle class, intellectuals, artisans and landowners, the Greek population of the Empire is in an interesting position within the state structure. Although the Anatolian Greeks are almost fully intertwined with their Turkish counterparts, the islands of the Aegean Coast and the special administrative unit of Cyprus are far less attached to Kostantiniyye.\n\nServing as hubs of §RGreek Nationalist§! rhetoric and often adhering to the dream of '§CMegali§!', these islands have proven themselves tricky to control and out of imperial control for multiple decades. Their return to the Empire after the collapse of first Italy and then the British Empire was not seen by all as a positive development and §RAnti-Ottoman§! rhetoric remains strong.

OTT_GRE_Abolish_Mutasarrifate코0=Abolish the Mutasarrifate of Kibris
OTT_GRE_Abolish_Mutasarrifate_desc코0=Although an experiment was executed in the late 19th Century when the Mutasarrifate was temporarily abolished and integrated into the Vilayet of the Archipelago, the attempt ultimately failed as the distance to its new capital (Çanakkale) led to a communication and administrative headache. The decision was ultimately reverted in 1870 when it became independent once more.\n\nA peculiar detail to the administrative status of the island is that for the authorities in Kostantiniyye, the Archbishop of the Orthodox Church on the island served as the sole representative of the entire Greek community and de facto serves as their ethnic leader in most matters.\n\nWith the recent reforms however and the grandiose plans of the OHF to abolish all the special and in their belief ancient structures, the status of the island is questioned once more and it is doubtful that Kostantiniyye will continue to govern the region through a religious proxy.
OTT_GRE_Central_Tax_Collection_Agency코0=Centralise Tax Collection (Greek Islands)
OTT_GRE_Central_Tax_Collection_Agency_desc코0=The present structures established throughout the Greek Isles have allowed for a wide plethora of sanctioned tax collectors ranging from the Millet level which distinguishes between religion, the Vilayet level which collects a certain amount of taxes based on an approximate geographical location and last but not least the OPDA which accounts for our debt repayment.\n\nAll together this has not only led to great confusion amongst the taxpayers but also outrage as the tax pressure seemingly increases by the day as each level of authority deems itself worthy of more and more income.\n\nTo eradicate this problem, a new plan has been proposed to combine all tax collection within a singular agency located in Izmir and from there on better regulate the expenses of the local government.
OTT_GRE_Turkish_Employement_Program코0=Implement the "Employ a Turk" Program
OTT_GRE_Turkish_Employement_Program_desc코0=Not only on the Greek isles but also on the mainland, Greek citizens have always taken up high positions within the industry and service industry with doctors, engineers and business owners being mostly Greek. This fairly closed off intellectual advantage has created a large social rift in Ottoman society where the ordinary Anatolian Turk remains stuck in the past and unable to participate in the industrial revolution.\n\nTo improve the status, experience and hopefully skill of these Turks, the government has decreed a new "Employ a Turk" program where business owners will be encouraged through financial aides to employ and train more of the Turkish population. Some of our non Turkish representatives have however countered this with the argument that this unfairly benefits one group of people which is in sharp contrast to the policy of equality proclaimed by the Party.
OTT_GRE_Enforce_Turkish_Curriculum코0=Enforce State Directed Curriculum
OTT_GRE_Enforce_Turkish_Curriculum_desc코0=Through the Millet system, the various religious and ethnic minorities of our Empire were able to establish their own distinct education system. In the past this has increasingly led to anti-Ottomanist and nationalist influence creeping into the minds of our children which is proving to be a major thorn in the side of the centralist administration.\n\nEradicating the issue straight at the roots through a standardised curriculum established in Kostantiniyye, we hope to combat this movement and bring the focus back to the Ottomanist ideal. This is sure to anger a vast portion of the Greek population who will see this as an attempt to Turkify their lands and might lead to violent protest should we not be careful.
OTT_GRE_Crack_Down_Tax_Havens코0=Combat Aegean Tax Paradises
OTT_GRE_Crack_Down_Tax_Havens_desc코0=Through a special construct created after the reconquest of the isles in 1919, the various Aegean Islands have been able to benefit from increased leniency of the tax collectors and have found themselves the regular home of various members of the Ottoman Upper Class. Sprouting majestic villas, large plantations and various other displays of their wealth there are even rumours that the Grand Vizier himself has a home there to repose from the tumult in the capital.\n\nThis has however also led to decreased revenue for the state and in a time where every penny counts and should be accounted for, the Ministry of Finance has announced a plan to send inspectors to the islands to turn over all rocks in search for extra revenue.
OTT_GRE_Timar_System코0=Expand the Timar System
OTT_GRE_Timar_System_desc코0=Shortly after the conquest of the island by Sultan Selim II, a system of land grants or Timars, for his victorious soldiers was established. This granted them land on the island, in the hopes of promoting a Turkish community on the otherwise predominately Greek island. This system has long remained in use and by the 19th Century, Kibris had a vibrant Turkish population centred around soldiers their descendants.\n\nThrough the plethora of wars we have been forced to endure over the decades, we once again have a large amount of Turkish veterans looking to settle down. By giving them Timars, we hope that they will integrate themselves within the Greek community and hopefully make the island more Ottoman oriented.

OTT_Kurd_Tooltip_GUI코0=The relationship between Kostantiniyye and the Kurdish population of Eastern Anatolia and Northern Mesopotamia has always been a precarious one filled with both cooperation and conflict. When the last Kurdish Princely Houses were dismantled in 1847–48 and Kurdistan was formally placed under direct rule from Kostantiniyye, a loss of native tradition and leadership occurred which has had catastrophic effects for the Kurds. The absence of authority to keep §RTribal Sheiks§! and §RFanatical Religious Leaders§! at bay, led to their increased power in the Eastern Vilayets and years of massacres throughout the region against non-Sunni citizens such as the §CArmenians§! or the §CAlevi§!.\n\nDuring the rule of §YAbdulhamid II§! and the last years of the §YCUP Autocracy§!, these were freely employed to massacres the §CArmenians§! or to restore order to unruly parts of the Empire and although aversion by the post-war establishment towards these practices is increasing, they still rule the Kurds as their allies such as the §YSufi order of the Naqshbandi§! hold vast §RInfluence§! in the capital and the Empire in general.\n\nThe autonomy they are currently enjoying however is a curse in disguise as the §YOHF§! has clearly shown their intentions to eradicate the regional power of these religious authorities and is planning to fundamentally change the freedom the §RKurdish Sheiks§! currently possess.

OTT_KUR_Centralise_Tax_Collection코0=Centralise Tax Collection (Kurdistan)
OTT_KUR_Centralise_Tax_Collection_desc코0=Even more so than in other regions of the Empire, the Eastern Vilayets of Anatolia are a region with little control by the central state and have been proven surprisingly resilient to reforms. On top of that, Ottoman Gendarmerie has trouble providing security to the citizens of the Empire as roads and paths, especially of the mountainous region are filled with bandits and highwaymen which make travel without escort a dangerous affair.\n\nTax Collectors are especially targeted as the Sheiks seem either incapable but more likely unwilling to provide the security necessary for a good functioning administration. As a cherry on top, the little taxes that do get collected more often than not never reach the Capital and either get embezzled or outright stolen.\n\nThe situation thus necessitates a large thorough reform which is likely to uproot a plethora of local traditions and insult existing power structures which will force us to use military force if necessary to make the whole affair be handled in an orderly fashion.
OTT_KUR_Complete_the_Copper_Line코0=Complete the Copper Line
OTT_KUR_Complete_the_Copper_Line_desc코0=Connecting the Kurdish city of Diyarbekir to the industrial and economic heart of South Eastern Anatolia, Adana, will prove fundamental to bring the modernisations employed in the West to the Kurdish heartland. More importantly it will also link up the capital of the Kurds to the railroad network enabling Ottoman forces to be transported and employed far faster than before.
OTT_KUR_Settlement_Law코0=Enact the [GetYear] Resettlement Law
OTT_KUR_Settlement_Law_desc코0=Law no. 2510 or the [GetYear] Resettlement Law grants the full authority to the Ottoman State to handle migration and immigration of certain population groups. What this means in practice is that it allows the government to mark certain regions as 'deemed in need of further assimilation' and resettle citizens within that region until this goal has been achieved.\n\nBeing first proposed by Yusuf Ziya Zarbun, the Law itself does not specify which populations fall under its various categories but it is no secret that it has been influenced by the Turkish Nationalist movement and that it will primarily target non-Turkish populations such as the remaining Armenian settlements of Eastern Anatolia and the Kurdish population.
OTT_KUR_Increase_Ottoman_Gendarmerie코0=Increase Ottoman Gendarmerie
OTT_KUR_Increase_Ottoman_Gendarmerie_desc코0=Serving as our main force of peacekeepers, the Ottoman Gendarmerie or Zaptı, already maintains a sizeable presence in Kurdistan to secure the protection of its citizens and the interests of Kostantiniyye. The vast distances and the low population density have spread our current force to its limits as reports of unrest close to the Armenian and Georgian borders are forced to go unanswered. Rising religious fanaticism as a reaction to the secularist reforms of the OHF has been left unchecked as well, as demagogues call for the end of their heretical rule.
OTT_KUR_Abolish_the_Hamidiye코0=Abolish the Hamidiye
OTT_KUR_Abolish_the_Hamidiye_desc코0=Created by Sultan Abdulhamid II in 1891, the Hamidiye was originally based on the Russian Cossacks to serve as border patrol on the Ottoman-Russian border. Their usage however quickly diverged from this purpose as they were employed to shut down Armenian nationalist and socialist revolutionaries. Partaking in a wide plethora of punitive actions and massacres on the Armenian population, the Hamidiye became known for their violence and corruption as they enriched themselves greatly. Through these actions, they were also able to achieve a wide degree of influence within Kurdistan, often positioning themselves above the Law and roaming the region with impunity.\n\nThroughout the Weltkrieg, they were able to increase this power even further as they played a key role in the Armenian Massacres. Post-war however, their power started to wane as the lack of Armenians to suppress and the increasing animosity between the Kurds and Kostantiniyye led to an increasing presence of Ottoman troops to pacify the region. Many former Hamidiye were forced to disintegrate and flocked to the banners of religious demagogues, bolstering the ranks of the conservative and extremist resistance to the Kemalist designs.

### Iraqi Integration

OTT_Handling_Iraqi_Vilayets_desc코0=§YIntegration of Iraqi Vilayets§! : §G[?OTT.irq_integration_factor]%§!\n\n(When §YIntegration of Iraqi Vilayets§! reaches §G50%§!, the Iraqi states can be upgraded to §YVilayet§! status and when it reaches more than §G100%§!, they can be upgraded to §YOttoman Province§! status)\n\nFor more info over the Iraqi region and its relation to the Porte, hover over the §CQuestion Mark§!.
OTT_Iraq_Tooltip_GUI코0=Both the richest and poorest region of the Ottoman Empire, Iraq is a region riddled with contradictions. After its conquest by Selim I, the region was home to the main battlefield between the §COttoman§! and §CPersian Empires§!. Serving as a §YBorder Province§!, it was also treated as such with development leaving much to be desired and §RPoverty§! widespread. Furthermore local groups would take control over the region during the 18th century and it would take until the middle of the 19th century before the actual Ottoman government could be restored to the region. The 19th century would bring much change to Iraq as in an attempt to counter the Persian and later §RRusso-British Threat§!, the government finally recognised the need for reform and invested considerable resources in settling tribes, constructing communication lines and later infrastructure (shown nowhere better than in the Berlin-Baghdad project). §CMidhat Pasha§!, wali of Baghdad and later the Grand Vizier who would introduce the Ottoman constitution of 1876, marked a significant leap in this regard as throughout the region from Mosul to Basra massive strides were taken.\n\nAs §REuropean Penetration§! rose however around the turn of the century and with the rise of §RArab Nationalism§! after the raid on the Sublime Porte, Iraq (although far less so than its Syrian and Hejazi counterparts) began to think of an alternative to Turkish rule. To counter these sentiments and to ensure a stable frontier, the post-war governments pumped tremendous resources into Iraq to mould it into a modern Ottoman province. §YEducation§!, §YConstruction§!, §YConscription§!, etc all saw massive increases as Iraqi officers and politicians were used to counter Syrian ambitions.

OTT_IRQ_Abolish_Assyrian_Autonomous_Zone코0=Abolish the Assyrian Autonomous Zone
OTT_IRQ_Abolish_Assyrian_Autonomous_Zone_desc코0=Established through the Basra Accords in 1920, the Assyrian community was granted special status in the Vilayet of Basra. Serving as the conductor for British influence in the entire Persian Gulf, they were able to prosper and slowly but surely build a new life far away from their homeland on the plains of Nineveh. This status however is not liked by all as the government in Kostantiniyye has desperately been trying to abolish it for years now.\n\nWith tensions rising across the globe and the Assyrian question once more coming to the forefront of Ottoman politics in Iraq, some are pushing for a direct resolution to the issue and the immediate abolishment of the zone, restoring the region to the full authority of the Baghdadi Wali.
OTT_IRQ_Basra_Harbour_Project코0=Enact the Basra Harbour Project
OTT_IRQ_Basra_Harbour_Project_desc코0=Providing the primary naval base for the Ottoman Empire in the Persian Gulf, the importance of Basra & Kuwait was recognised during the 19th century as the grip of the Sultan on the Emirs of Arabia waned drastically in favour of the British. The British Empire, supported by its formidable fleet was able to provide a better alternative to the pitiful Ottoman navy and even though the Porte recognised this issue, was unable to solve it. The collapse of the British Empire and the shock waves it sent throughout the Middle East have been especially felt in this region as the Ottoman Empire suddenly found itself the main naval power in the Gulf.\n\nIt could however do little with this as the facilities in Basra, albeit reinforced by the British during the Weltkrieg, were incapable of supporting the main Ottoman fleet and as such only a small, insignificant squadron could be placed in this pivotal region. To mediate this issue and once more extend the Sultans power to the Emirates, a development program has been set up to expand the Basra harbour whilst reinforcing the defences around the city to prevent another Fao Fortress catastrophe.
OTT_IRQ_Mosul_Development코0=Execute the Tigris Program
OTT_IRQ_Mosul_Development_desc코0=Less so than the Arab cities in Syria, the city of Mosul and its surroundings are closely connected to the Turkish economy and are more tightly knit into the regional administration of Anatolia. Furthermore its population also consists of a tapestry of different ethnicities and religions: Kurds from the east of the Vilayet, Turkomans from the cities of Kirkuk and Mosul, Turks and Jews in Mosul and Arabs throughout the entire region. The growing importance of oil for the Ottoman (war) economy however has led many in Kostantiniyye to believe that extra measures should be taken to ensure that should war return to the region, Mosul will clearly throw its lot in with the Turks and that control over Kirkuk can under no circumstances be lost.\n\nRapid expansion of the railroads in the region, linking Mosul to Diyarbakir and Kirkuk are vital in this whilst the arsenals of Iraq (usually located in Baghdad) should in some capacity be shifted to Mosul and Kirkuk. Fears of a Fifth Column amidst the Shiite Arabs of Southern Iraq and the Assyrians in Basra are further influencing government policy to take control over the region in its own hands.
OTT_IRQ_Navigation_Law코0=Enact the Tigris & Euphrates Navigation Law
OTT_IRQ_Navigation_Law_desc코0=The Tigris and the Euphrates are the lifeblood of Iraq. For millennia these two massive rivers have brought bounty onto the Iraqi land but have also caused conflict, misery and violence. It thus goes without saying that control over these rivers is of vital importance for any governmental body in Iraq willing to exert control. Nonetheless it would take significant effort from the Ottoman Empire to fully benefit from this water highway as due to unpredictable behaviour and the terrain on which it runs, issues were plentiful.\n\nIn this the British reached a breakthrough in the late 19th century as the introduction of steamers on the river drastically increased both the value of the land and the control by Ottoman officials. A steamer service connected to Oman and Jeddah was set up and whilst Ottoman ships slowly closed the gap with the British, 'damage' was already done. The influence of Britain increased drastically at the loss of the Porte whilst other Western powers found their way into the mostly untapped Iraqi hinterland. The end of the Weltkrieg did little to ameliorate this as British control over the mouth of the rivers remained. It would take until 1927 for the Porte to regain control over its sphere of influence in the Persian Gulf and navigation on the rivers became more and better controlled.\n\nNonetheless Ottoman traffic on the rivers is far from where the government believes it should be. To solve this and to place the entire Land of the Two Rivers solidly under their foot, a new proposal lies on the table to nationalise all transportation and communication companies on the rivers and prohibit foreign vessels from sailing upstream. Furthermore new patrol boats would be acquired to guard the commercial vessels whilst increased checks in the harbours of the various cities should hopefully both catch illegal merchandise and raise revenue.
OTT_IRQ_Iraqi_Road_System코0=Expand Farm-to-City Connections
OTT_IRQ_Iraqi_Road_System_desc코0=Control over the inhabitants of Iraq remains problematic as an entrenched aversion by the local people to anything even associated with administration prevents a constructive policy. Farmers toiling on the fields and members of the massive tribal confederations see no need in going to urban areas and due to the massive distances in Iraq, this leads to a situation where only those in the cities have an influence on state policy whilst the economy is unable to grow as agricultural goods do not reach an export centre nor do their creators purchase consumer goods, deteriorating the pitiful revenue of what is supposed to be a rich province.\n\nTo solve this issue, the government has chosen to embark on a Farm-to-City project. Constructing and expanding the existing road network, they will attempt to bring the two groups closer to each other and as such boost the economy of Iraq in general. By providing the means, the government hopes that the rural regions will as such transport their goods to the city where enticed by the richness of the modern consumer goods market, they will spread these to their friends and families. To ensure that these roads remain safe, the government has also authorised the purchase of armoured cars for the Iraqi gendarmerie and has commenced training of new mounted police regiments to tackle banditry in the region.
OTT_IRQ_Coordinate_Shia_Tourism코0=Regulate Shiite Pilgrims
OTT_IRQ_Coordinate_Shia_Tourism_desc코0=Some of the Holiest places in the Shiite sect of Islam are located in Iraq. Much like Sunnis travel to Mecca and Medina, many Shiites (mainly Iranians) embark on a journey to the cities of Najaf and Karbala. This both brings us an advantage and a disadvantage, as whilst these centres of faith are exerting tremendous influence on the Iraqi population, whose composition has now drastically shifted in favour of Shiite demographic domination, they also provide us with a special way to influence Iranian policy. Many influential imams and religious officials are educated at these sites and those that remain in Iraq still exert their influence over the Iranian realm as proven by events in the late 19th and early 20th century.\n\nWith relations deteriorating with our Eastern neighbour however, many in Kostantiniyye believe that it would beneficial to our regime to tighten restrictions on Persian pilgrims travelling to the cities and to bring the educational facilities located there under closer supervision of the government.

OTT_Libya_Tooltip_GUI코0=Actually consisting of three distinct regions, the §Y'Regency of Tripolitania'§! has been at the side of the Sultan ever since 1551. Despite its age, the government in Kostantiniyye didn't interfere much in its local affairs as its poverty and lack of a decent agricultural base made it too expensive to embark on costly military campaigns to quell the local tribes. Nonetheless, what the Italians would refer to as "§CLibya§!" formed a vital piece in the Trans-Saharan trade as the oases of Fezzan were the last stop before the Sahel. The sheer size of the region ensured that Ottoman control was barely felt outside of a few coastal centres and it would take until the American invasion in the early 19th Century before the Porte would finally take measures to tie it further to the crown.\n\nThe implementation of the §YTanzimat Reforms§! saw little success in the region as only in Tripolitania much progress could be recorded. It would take until the turn of the century before the changes of the Ottoman regime would start to infiltrate the interior but even then, §CFezzan§! and §CCyrenaica§! were left almost entirely untouched.\n\nThe Italian invasion in 1911 did little to affect the general social structure in the region as the Ottomans notables which governed the coastal strip returned from their exile and retook their place in society. As Ottoman attention was drawn to the Mashriq and saddled with the economic depression caused by the Weltkrieg, the region saw §Rlittle economic development§!. §RIlliteracy§! (outside the main cities) is higher than anywhere else in the Empire, the economy still largely depends on the rainfall in a given year and the few industrial operations running before the war have almost all been forced to close down as a §Rlack of export partners and resources§! makes anything but limited agriculture nigh-impossible.

OTT_TRI_Tripoli_Benghazi_Railway코0=Construct the Tripoli-Benghazi Railway
OTT_TRI_Tripoli_Benghazi_Railway_desc코0=One of the major issues that has plagued the Regency is that all three of its regions suffer from a lack of interconnectivity. Hindered by natural obstacles, Cyrenaica and Tripolitania couldn't be further apart as the great sand sea east of Sirte makes all transportation outside of sea routes nigh impossible. Furthermore many of the more inland territories of Cyrenaica and Tripolitania aren't even connected to the coast which has led to yet another divide between the urban centres of Tripoli, Benghazi, Misrata and the pastoral villages deep in the Jabal.\n\nEven though an initial attempt at rail connectivity was attempted in the twenties, this network was uncompleted due to a lack of funding or local enthusiasm. The new government however has made railroads their number one priority and has decreed that it will extend the metal beasts to the far-flung deserts of Tripolitania. Connecting the city of Benghazi with Misrata and Tripoli, this is not only an incredibly ambitious plan but also one likely to weigh heavily on the local population which will be required to cough up a sizeable part of the investment.
OTT_TRI_Fezzan_Expedition코0=Increase Ottoman garrisons in Fezzan
OTT_TRI_Fezzan_Expedition_desc코0=When Ottoman rule was restored to the Fezzan interior during the middle of the twenties, few accepted it with open arms and during the subsequent years the regime in Tripoli decided that maintaining a sizeable force in the region would be too costly. Retreating all troops bar some small garrisons in the urban centres, this has led to an almost entirely autonomous position for the local tribes.\n\nThey remain discontent however and influenced by a resurgence of the Senussi sect, tribes such as the Awlad Muhammad have started to show their resistance to the regime more clearly. Raids on Ottoman garrisons, refusal to pay taxes and be conscripted have caused drastic issues for the few remaining forces in the region.\n\nA military expedition from the coast could restore order to the region but with the large economic crisis still reigning, many wonder if it wouldn't be best to withdraw all garrisons and grant the region de facto self-rule. In Tripolitania, there is less animus to abandon the region as the valuable date production of Fezzan is essential in a nation with so little rainfall.
OTT_TRI_Centralise_Taxation코0=Centralise Tax Collection (Tripolitania)
OTT_TRI_Centralise_Taxation_desc코0=Taxes have always been an iffy subject for the tribes of Tripolitania, and have caused the vast majority of uprisings against Ottoman rule in the past. As the Ottoman control only really extends to the main urban centres, tax collection in the hinterland is a tricky subject. To solve this, the Ottoman state has attempted to cooperate with the tribes and grant positions of tax collector, administrator, judge and police to certain tribal chiefs. By using tribes to make other tribes pay their dues, the system turned out much more effective than a pure reliance on Ottoman personnel. The issue here however is that the loyalty of those tribes isn't always guaranteed and certain political fluctuations in the Jabal can cause significant issues to the budget of the region.\n\nThe new administration is less keen on continuing this practice and is planning to make greater use of the kuloglu (Tripolitanians with Turkish ancestry) in the administration of the province. Furthermore it also wishes to break up the quasi monopoly of Jewish merchants in the urban centres of Tripoli and Benghazi, in line with the National Economy model.
OTT_TRI_Misrata_Program코0=Enact the Misrata Program
OTT_TRI_Misrata_Program_desc코0=Named after the city of Misrata, the stronghold of the Turko-Libyan population of Tripolitania, the program aims to greatly improve the infrastructure and economy of Tripolitania and reduce its autonomy by binding it closer to the state monopolies and the civil service.
OTT_TRI_Combat_Senussi_Order코0=Combat Senussi Influence
OTT_TRI_Combat_Senussi_Order_desc코0=Founded by the Great al-Senussi in the 19th century, the exiled founder of the Sufi Order found in the underdeveloped and isolated region of Cyrenaica an excellent basis to build his Order. The Senussi order expanded quickly, establishing itself as a de facto independent state within the Ottoman empire already in the 19th century.\n\nTheir influence however didn't remain limited to Cyrenaica as the message of anti-imperialism spread quickly across all of Northern Africa. Although they officially promote solidarity and unity within the Sunni faith, their relation with the Caliph has been less ideal and their anti-imperialist message has turned both our enemies and our allies away from our hold.
OTT_TRI_Settle_Tripolitanian_Tribes코0=Settle the Southern Tripolitanian Tribes
OTT_TRI_Settle_Tripolitanian_Tribes_desc코0=Consisting of various ethnicities and religions, the tribes of Tripolitania have never felt much loyalty to the Ottoman state (or any state for that matter), being only brought into the fold after the destruction of the Tripolitanian state by Turkish and American forces in the 19th century. Much like in the Mashriq, the tribes continue to consist of large Bedouin populations who stay out of the grip of the Ottoman civil service, making conscription and levying taxes a nigh impossible matter.

OTT_Millet_Mektepleri_dec_desc코0=The §CMillet Mektepleri§! or Nation School is the brainchild of the OHF, most importantly its minister of education §YMustafa Necati§! and has as grand aim to make the entire Ottoman population literate.\n\nFocusing on the age bracket 14-45, these 'schools' are compulsory for all citizens including women and prisoners. Two courses per week are offered to women while four courses a week are available for men. The duration of this program is 2–4 months depending on the prior education of the participants, after which they will be granted a certificate from the state.

OTT_prorogue_parliament_desc코0=Walking on the thin line between constitutional and illegal, proroguing parliament is the only tool currently available to the Sultan to enact his own reforms and govern without the oversight normally imposed through the Chamber of Deputies. Allowing significant leeway through this action, continued delay will likely only further ignite the powder keg as anti-monarchists have long been searching for a way to rid themselves of the Sultan whilst even the most aristocratic liberals find it hard to justify strong royal action in times such as these.
OTT_early_elections코0=Hold Early Elections
OTT_early_elections_desc코0=As support for the coalition has mostly evaporated, the Grand Vizier sees no other solution than to submit his resignation to the Sultan and requests parliament to be disbanded.

OTT_congress_turkish_nationalists_desc코0=The group of 'Turkish Nationalists' is hard to pin down as whilst the majority of them resides within the OHF, a group of deputies with more radical ideas and who want to see a split between the Arab and Turkish parts of the empire have separated themselves. In many ways these are extremists with the ideas of Turanism or Turkic Unity held up high which makes for difficult negotiation partners.\n\n§YState Interactions§! on the Turkish vilayets (§GEdirne, Kostantiniyye, Bursa, Izmir, Afyon, Mugla, Ankara, Kastamonu, Samsun, Adana, Western Thrace, Mestanli§!) will either increase or decrease the number of £deputies_texticon §Ydeputies§! in support of our coalition.\n\n§GSupportive§!: [?OTT.nat_tur_sup_deputies]/[?OTT.nat_tur_deputies]\n§ROpposition§!: [OTT_congress_turkish_nationalist_opposition]/[?OTT.nat_tur_deputies]\n

OTT_con_halkevleri_program코0=Fund the Halkevleri Program
OTT_con_halkevleri_program_desc코0=Working in close cooperation with the Turkish Hearts, the Halkevleri or 'People's Houses' are used by Turkish nationalists to fertilise the growing national consciousness of the Turks. In their attempts to prove that the Turks have always inhabited Anatolia, that Hittites and Sumerians were also Turks and that all shapes of human culture in some way or another are connected to the Turks, they promote a blatant abstraction of the truth to spread their beliefs of Turkic unity and Pan-Turanism.\n\nWhilst these institutions for now wield little influence as they are completely reliant on donations and contributions from the people, their network is starting to grow as opposition to the decentralist ideas of the HIF fuels their expansion. To partially solve this issue and hopefully get some support from the Turkish nationalists, we could take these Halkevleri under our wing and provide them with state funding. This would also allow us to make some 'changes' to their message and hopefully guide them towards promoting cultural diversity instead of cultural superiority.
OTT_con_anatolian_relief_program코0=Fund the Anatolian Agricultural Relief Program
OTT_con_anatolian_relief_program_desc코0=One of the largest victims of the global depression is the Anatolian heartland. Almost entirely reliant on agriculture and still trying to recuperate from the immense loss of population during the Weltkrieg, many farmers have descended into complete poverty as the support network proves to be inadequate for their needs. These Anatolian peasants, who in large part also form the backbone of the Ottoman military are easy targets for the OHF and other centralist parties as their promises for relief are exactly what these voters need to hear.\n\nThe "Anatolian Relief Program", funded through the Ziraat Bankasi would provide solace here as it would take the wind from under the wings of the OHF and consequently also increase our own support base amongst the lower classes.
OTT_con_turkish_language_decree코0=Enforce Ottomanish in the Administration

Although the upper levels such as parliament were still dictated to be Ottomanish only, as proscribed by the constitution, the large number of Arab deputies has in recent times given rise to a rising degree of Arab conversing within the administration.\n\nThe Turkish nationalists, greatly angered by this breach of protocol and fearing an imminent domination of the Arab language in the empire if no harsh measures are taken, have entered a proposal in parliament which will enforce the language article of the constitution and which will make the use of Ottomanish obligatory on all levels above the municipal council.

### Arab Nationalist
OTT_congress_arab_nationalists코0=Arab Nationalists
OTT_congress_arab_nationalists_desc코0=Dispersed in a wide variety of smaller regional parties, the Arab nationalists differ on many topics but are all united in the pursuit of larger autonomy for the Arab people. Some see in this a dual-monarchy between Turks and Arabs whilst others see the creation of an independent Arab state as the sole solution. One thing is for certain however, cooperating with the Kemalists is absolutely impossible as they view their policies as Turkish imperialism, the death of Islam and the downfall of Arab civilisation.\n\n§YState Interactions§! on the Arab vilayets (§RAleppo, Homs, Damascus, Haifa, Lebanon, Mosul, Baghdad, Tripolitania, Benghazi§!) will either increase or decrease the number of £deputies_texticon §Ydeputies§! in support of our coalition.\n\n§GSupportive§!: [?OTT.nat_ara_sup_deputies]/[?OTT.nat_ara_deputies]\n§ROpposition§!: [OTT_congress_arab_nationalist_opposition]/[?OTT.nat_ara_deputies]\n

OTT_con_concessions_to_tribes코0=Grant Concessions to the Tribal Confederations

### Conservative
OTT_congress_conservatives코0=Conservatives
OTT_congress_conservatives_desc코0=Contrary to the other factions, the conservatives are fairly united in their goals for the Ottoman Empire. Hailing mostly from aristocratic or religious families, many of these believe that the 1908 revolution and the subsequent Young Turk government were the biggest mistakes that ever befell the empire. They grasp back to an era where everything was simpler, everything was more traditional and where the morality of the Islam was followed closer to the letter. Having closely worked with the deposed Sultan Abdulhamid II, their ideas are received fairly well amongst the large conservative - and often illiterate - Ottoman Muslim crowd but are feared greatly by the various religious and ethnic minorities of the Empire who by no means share their love for the Hamidian Era.\n\n§YState Interactions§! on the Conservative vilayets (§CKonya, Diyarbakir, Erzurum, Kars, Lazistan, Van, Ma'an, Medina, Hejaz, Fezzan§!) will either increase or decrease the number of £deputies_texticon §Ydeputies§! in support of our coalition.\n\n§GSupportive§!: [?OTT.con_sup_deputies]/[?OTT.con_deputies]\n§ROpposition§!: [OTT_congress_conservative_opposition]/[?OTT.con_deputies]\n\n§RConservative support is brittle at best. If their fraction becomes malcontent, they may collapse the government and seize power for themselves.§!\n

OTT_con_mosque_renovation_program코0=Fund the Ministry of Religious Affairs
OTT_con_legalise_polygamy코0=Revert OHF Social Reforms
OTT_con_fund_medreses코0=Fund the Medreses

### Independents
OTT_congress_independents코0=Independents
OTT_congress_independents_desc코0=Far from a united force, the independents represent the wide array of deputies and interest groups of the minority regions. Maronites from Mt Lebanon, Kurds from Sulaymaniyah, Assyrians from Basra, Greeks from Cyprus, etc etc. Most of these groups seek some comfort under the wings of the HIF but a significant number remain which are discontent with their policies and which refuse to work together with a coalition in which Turkish nationalists hold significant sway.\n\n§YState Interactions§! on the Independent vilayets (§gAegean Islands, Dodecanese, Cyprus, Latakia, Sivas, Batumi, Sulaymaniyah, Basra, Jerusalem, Trebizond, Abu Dhabi, Bahrain, Qatar§!) will either increase or decrease the number of £deputies_texticon §Ydeputies§! in support of our coalition.\n\n§GSupportive§!: [?OTT.ind_sup_deputies]/[?OTT.ind_deputies]\n§ROpposition§!: [OTT_congress_independent_opposition]/[?OTT.ind_deputies]\n

# Ottoman General Assembly #
############################
OTT_congress코0=Chamber of Deputies
OTT_assembly_desc코0=Situated in the Imperial capital of Kostantiniyye, the §YMeclis-i Mebusân§! or Chamber of Deputies serves as the Lower House in the Ottoman bicameral §YGeneral Assembly§!. With deputies sent by all Vilayets in the Empire, there is representation from the Gulf of Aden to Edirne and from Cyprus to Baghdad. To create order in this myriad of ethnicities, religious affiliations and languages, these deputies have organised in 2 main power blocs: The centralist §COHF§! and the decentralist §CLiberal Entente§!. This latter body consists of a multitude of smaller regional parties with more often than not conflicting opinions, only stuck together to oppose the centralists.

### Politics (Kemalist)
OTT_Judicial_Commision코0=Found the Judicial Commission
OTT_Judicial_Commision_desc코0=As the Ottoman civil code is based on the Sharia, in the shape of the Mecelle, many of the reformers have been attempting to replace it with a modernised and secular variant. An attempt at doing so was started in 1930 but the electoral defeat in 1931, forced the OHF to re-evaluate its position. Now that the party is back in charge, it seems only natural to push it once more.
OTT_Expand_the_Education_Ministry코0=Expand the Education Ministry
OTT_Expand_the_Education_Ministry_desc코0=Fighting an uphill battle ever since the revolution in 1908, the topic of education is of the utmost importance to the OHF. Significant steps have been made in this regard, especially on the matter of co-education, but the decentralisation of the Ottoman Education System remains a thorn in the side. With the upcoming Co-education and Unification Decree, these will be annihilated in one fell swoop!
OTT_Replace_the_Penal_Code코0=Replace the Penal Code
OTT_Replace_the_Penal_Code_desc코0=Whilst the current Penal Code serves us well, the Grand Vizier has been enticed by reforms enacted in [ITA.GetNameDef]. It not only provides us with a better and modernised code but it also includes special clauses targeting political dissidents such as the syndicalist movement, which seem a useful tool to the administration.
OTT_Single_Party_Dictatorship코0=Install the Single Party Dictatorship
OTT_Single_Party_Dictatorship_desc코0=Ottoman democracy has failed us. Whilst the Grand Vizier is a staunch supporter of the will of his people, he believes that a progressive vanguard is necessary to lift the Ottoman people up. This vanguard can only function if it can act with total power, free from conservative meddling.
OTT_Abolish_Mecelle코0=Abolish the Mecelle Code
OTT_Abolish_Mecelle_desc코0=Following the suggestions made by the Judicial Commission, the time has finally come to rid ourselves of the Mecelle. A new civil code, fully secular in nature, will treat all Ottoman citizens as equals and will show the desire to tear down the last conservative anchor points.
OTT_Commision_Ottomanish_Language코0=Reform the Ottoman Language
OTT_Commision_Ottomanish_Language_desc코0=Based on a Perso-Arabic script, many of the more radical reformers within the Party believe the Ottoman language is needlessly complicated and therefore hindering literacy programs. They have therefore pushed towards the adoption of the Latin Script with the necessary adjustments to fit the Turkish language.
OTT_Reform_Millet_System코0=Reform the Millet System
OTT_Reform_Millet_System_desc코0=The Millet System was a creation to ensure that Ottoman citizens who did not practice the Islamic faith could govern themselves and as such limit sectarian conflict. This has over the years however, led to non-Muslim citizens almost completely detaching themselves from the Empire, and has encouraged the disaster that followed in the Balkans. With a new Civil Code, surely this system is no longer necessary?

OTT_Ottoman_Constitution코0=Procuring a New Constitution
OTT_Ottoman_Constitution_desc코0=Our current constitution dates from 1876 when Abdulhamid II was forced to concede power to the Young Ottomans. Despite a temporary setback between 1878-1908, this same constitution would be brought back by the Young Turks during the constitutional revolution. Many believe the document is dated however and gives unnecessary power to the office of the Sultan. A revision is in order!
OTT_Secure_Seperation_of_Powers코0=Guarantee the Separation of Powers
OTT_Secure_Seperation_of_Powers_desc코0=When the Empire in 1878 returned to the rule of the Sultan, it quickly became apparent how this was detrimental to the nation. Arbitrary decisions and the concentration of so much power in the hands of a single person who could decree laws, condemn prisoners and take control over estates he fancied will not do in the 20th century. Therefore it is important that we limit the power of the Padishah.
OTT_Reorganise_Vilayet_System코0=Reorganise the Vilayet System
OTT_Reorganise_Vilayet_System_desc코0=The current size of our Vilayets is far too large, and as such encourage concentration of power within local figures. By reducing the size of them and through the expansion of our telegraph and radio network, we can make them more dependent on the capital and have less power to mismanage.
OTT_Millet_Mektepleri코0=Millet Mektepleri
OTT_Millet_Mektepleri_desc코0=The Millet Mektepleri or Nation School is the brainchild of Minister of Education Mustafa Necati and has a grand aim to make the entire Ottoman population literate. Focusing on the age bracket 14-45, these 'schools' are compulsory for all citizens including women and prisoners. After completing a test, the participants will be granted a certificate from the state and join the Modern Ottoman society.
OTT_Emancipation_Push코0=Emancipation Vanguard
OTT_Emancipation_Push_desc코0=Through the co-education act, we have laid the first bricks on the road to emancipation. Nonetheless this is only the beginning as the OHF now also plans to enable women to run for office and vote in the national elections. A variety of professions will also be opened up to women as the war has shown the chronic lack of labour force amongst the Anatolian people.
OTT_Curtail_Religious_Organisations코0=Curtail Religious Organisations
OTT_Curtail_Religious_Organisations_desc코0=If the Empire is ever to advance towards a secular institution, we have to take decisive action against the various religious organisations shouting their opposition to the reforms. The Sufi orders form the most significant hurdle in this as they not only de facto control Eastern Anatolia but have direct contacts with the Caliph who they utilise to remain in power. No more!

### Maintaining Internal Order (Kemalist)
OTT_Maintenance_of_Order_Law코0=Pass the Maintenance of Order Law
OTT_Maintenance_of_Order_Law_desc코0=Tough times necessitate tough measures and the "Law for the Maintenance of Public Order" is exactly this. To combat the internal enemies of our fair state, this law will extend dictatorial powers to the office of the Grand Vizier and extend the capability of the army to restore public order. Furthermore it will also allow us to crush subversive organisations - such as the opposition - with ease.

OTT_Reeling_in_the_Arab_Vilayets코0=Reeling in the Arab Vilayets
OTT_Reeling_in_the_Arab_Vilayets_desc코0=As political control over the Turkish heartland increases, so should we extend this to our Arab subjects in the Mashriq and Tripolitania. Be it through political appointments, economic development or military force, the old aristocratic order will be pushed out to make place for the new Ottoman citizen, a young, intellectual and proud servant of the Sultan.
OTT_Reform_the_Conscription_System코0=Reform the Conscription System
OTT_Reform_the_Conscription_System_desc코0=Regularly used by the Ottoman army to cover its flanks or to perform the 'dirty' work, irregulars make up a not insignificant amount of our army. They are often recruited from Kurdish, Syrian and Iraqi tribes and are highly disloyal and untrustworthy assets to the army. The time has come to eradicate this practice and incorporate any stranglers into the full Ottoman Army.
OTT_Crack_down_on_the_SSNP코0=Crack Down on Arab Parties
OTT_Crack_down_on_the_SSNP_desc코0=Through their printing presses in Beirut and their Radio broadcasts from Cairo, a whole slew of Arab movements has popped up throughout Greater Syria. Fighting against the modernisation of the Empire and trying to persuade people that an "Arab" nation would be beneficial to their lives, it is the duty of any decent government to spare the people from these delusions.
OTT_Order_by_the_Locomotive코0=Order by the Locomotive
OTT_Order_by_the_Locomotive_desc코0=The sheer size of the empire has made control over the periphery tricky for centuries. As the Ottoman system of the 19th century strongly relied on control from the centre, inadequate infrastructure often made responding to crises slow. Pioneered by the Hejaz Railway and later the Istanbul-Baghdad Railway, the empire can now strike anywhere at any time.
OTT_Status_of_the_Autonomous_Regions코0=Status of the Autonomous Regions
OTT_Status_of_the_Autonomous_Regions_desc코0=Under the CUP dictatorship, many of the old autonomous regions and special statuses were firmly abolished in favour of a strong centralised state. Pressured by the international community, conservatives and the Sultan himself, much of their work would be undone after the conclusion of the Weltkrieg. Now that the centralists are back in charge, the time is ripe to finish what our predecessors started.
OTT_Tribunals_of_Progress코0=Tribunals of Progress
OTT_Tribunals_of_Progress_desc코0=Working in close cooperation with the Law on the Maintenance of Public Order, the "Kalkınma Mahkemeleri" are mobile military tribunals sent out by the office of the Grand Vizier to restore order throughout the empire. Headed by dedicated followers of the Pasha, these men will do whatever necessary to ensure the much needed reforms can't be stopped by the banalities of the opposition.

OTT_Reeling_in_the_Anatolian_Vilayets코0=Reeling in the Anatolian Vilayets
OTT_Reeling_in_the_Anatolian_Vilayets_desc코0=Many nationalists see the entirety of Anatolia as one unit but this couldn't be less true as a variety of peoples ranging from Bosnian to Kurdish inhabit its highlands. Furthermore there is a divide between those living on the coast and those of the interior, often been left behind in favour of more prosperous regions. Uniting these people under the modern interpretation of "Ottoman" is thus our task.
OTT_Extend_Authority_Kurdish_Territories코0=Extend Authority over the Kurds
OTT_Extend_Authority_Kurdish_Territories_desc코0=Divided in tribes and other communities, Sheikhs and Aghas still dictate the order of the day in Kurdistan. For over a century, the Ottoman reform movement has been trying to rid themselves of their influence and bring the Kurdish people under the control of Kostantiniyye. Be it peacefully or through the use of force, we will succeed in the end!
OTT_Expand_Halkevleri코0=Expand the Halkevleri Program
OTT_Expand_Halkevleri_desc코0=Even though our reforms are set to bring greater prosperity, greater freedom and massive strides in all fields many don't agree with this vision. Especially in the countryside many have serious doubts about the length at which the reforms will change society and are afraid these are in fact heresy. To show the people their virtue, we will create the "People's Houses", community centres to explain the programs.
OTT_Eradicate_Military_Disloyalty코0=Eradicate Military Disloyalty
OTT_Eradicate_Military_Disloyalty_desc코0=Most of the military is in full support of their Grand Vizier or his allies in the army but there nonetheless exists a movement that is less interested in Kemal's ever-increasing power and who believe that many of his programs will not 'fix' the Empire as he claims but instead hasten its demise. We may need to 'correct' this...
OTT_OHP_Membership_Reward_Program코0=OHF Membership Reward Program
OTT_OHP_Membership_Reward_Program_desc코0=Grasping back to our predecessor, the CUP, politics have become something not solely decided by the privy council but a true mass movement. Whilst this means that we no longer have to pay lip-service to a few select upper class notables, we still need to adapt our program to the needs of our support base or if one doesn't exist, create one ourselves through carefully placed notables.

### Internal Policy Post-CP
OTT_Ottoman_Renaissance코0=Dawn of the Ottoman Renaissance
OTT_Ottoman_Renaissance_desc코0=The Europeans deemed us weak and sickly, the Iranian believed we wouldn't risk confronting them, and the Arabs believed they were an equal match for the power of Turkish boots. With the white crescent on a red field flying on ramparts from Cairo to Lake Urmiah, we have once and for all shown that our decline has been firmly halted and turned around!

OTT_Reform_on_the_Homefront코0=Stabilise the Homefront
OTT_Reform_on_the_Homefront_desc코0=The necessities of war and the Kemalist reforms which had to be pushed through without the distractions caused by popular sentiment forced our regime to restrict certain 'liberties' of our citizens. With the death of Mustafa Kemal however, it is quickly becoming apparent that the same authoritarian rule won't remain feasible without his charisma and prestige.
OTT_Lift_Press_Restrictions코0=Lift Press Restrictions
OTT_Lift_Press_Restrictions_desc코0=As part of the authoritarian measures installed to ensure total control over the war situation and to smother conservative/Islamic resistance to the reforms, the press was heavily curtailed and only commentaries backed by the Party were allowed for publication. With the recent pressure on the authoritarian government to liberalise, we should lift the restrictions.
OTT_Repeal_Varlik_Vargisi코0=Repeal the Varlik Vargisi
OTT_Repeal_Varlik_Vargisi_desc코0=The 'Varlik Vargisi' is a specific war tax which targets rich Armenians and Jews to fund the operations of the government. By putting exorbitant burdens on these groups, the policy both serves to remedy the ever-increasing deficit and to bolster the 'National Economy' by pushing the non-Muslims out of business and encourage take-overs by Turkish citizens.
OTT_Lift_Ban_Political_Parties코0=Lift Ban on Political Organisations
OTT_Lift_Ban_Political_Parties_desc코0=As the authority of the central government crumbles on all sides and voices both inside and outside of the Party are calling for an end to authoritarianism, our Grand Vizier has decided to lift the ban on political organisations and organise open elections as soon as possible.

OTT_Egypt_Khedivate코0=Khedivate Restored
OTT_Egypt_Khedivate_desc코0=The focus of the Ottoman state should lay on Anatolia and the Levant as further expansion will only lead to a worsening of our internal troubles and upset the Turkish plurality within the nation. As the deposed Khedive, Abbas Hilmi, still enjoys the luxuries of his Bosporus villa, we could establish closer ties between our two states but keep them as separate entities.
OTT_Cairo_Aleppo코0=Cairo-Aleppo Development Scheme
OTT_Cairo_Aleppo_desc코0=The growing importance of the petroleum industry and the increasing demand from Europe for this black gold, have shifted priority for the Central Planning Board to the development of a strong industrial basis in the Levant and improve the export capacities of the Empire. Utilising the revenue of the oil business, we will furthermore expand the textile industry of Syria. 
OTT_Absorb_Egyptian_State_Assets코0=Absorb Egyptian State Assets
OTT_Absorb_Egyptian_State_Assets_desc코0=The Egyptian aristocracy and a small group of oligarchs control the vast majority of Egyptian land and industry, forcing the Egyptian people to live as impoverished Fellahin on their lands. By enforcing the Ottoman land reform in the newly 'liberated' lands and through sales of these vast estates, we can both fill our coffers and increase Ottoman penetration of their economy.
OTT_Ottoman_Authority_Peninsula코0=Reaffirm Authority on the Peninsula
OTT_Ottoman_Authority_Peninsula_desc코0=For too long have the tribes of the Arabian peninsula been able to raid and plunder Ottoman supply lines and contest our rule on the periphery. To follow in the footsteps of great administrators such as Midhat Pasha, the time has come for the Empire to strengthen its southern flank and crush the influence of Wahhabists and Emirs alike.
OTT_Restore_the_Vilayet_of_Najd코0=Create the Vilayet of al-Hasa
OTT_Restore_the_Vilayet_of_Najd_desc코0=Our hold on the Arabian peninsula has always been a tenuous affair as the state preferred demanding fealty from the local emirs than exert direct control. Change was brought to this when Midhat Pasha retook al-Hasa and extended Ottoman control further inland but pressed on all fronts, the Saudis were able to force us out in 1913. With the discovery of oil, the time has come to restore our rule over the Gulf. 
OTT_Handle_the_Yemeni_Affair코0=Handle the Yemeni Affair
OTT_Handle_the_Yemeni_Affair_desc코0=The Imam has made the crucial mistake to doubt Ottoman superiority on the field of battle and has as such thrown away any chances at retaining the special status of his realm. Holed up in their mountains and believing themselves untouchable by the Ottoman Army, they are in for a rude awakening...
OTT_Lift_Military_Restrictions코0=Lift Military Restrictions
OTT_Lift_Military_Restrictions_desc코0=As part of the treaty imposed on the Egyptian state after their defeat in the Levantine war, the size of their military was limited to 20.000 as to not present a threat to our interests. The rise of tensions across the world however and the vulnerability of the Canal and the Libyan flank have made us consider lifting these limitations and use the Egyptian manpower to defend the Caliphate.
OTT_United_Once_More코0=United Once More
OTT_United_Once_More_desc코0=The disaster that befell the Ottoman state in the 19th century and which was only aggravated at the turn of the 20th century has now been corrected as Istanbul and Cairo are now finally reunited! To prevent this from happening again however, the government has decreed an extensive reorganisation of both parts of the Empire including economic, administrative and cultural adjustments.
OTT_Haifa_Cairo_Railroad코0=Construct the Haifa-Cairo Railroad
OTT_Haifa_Cairo_Railroad_desc코0=As an important axis throughout the entirety of human history, we should improve the connection between the lands of the Tigris/Euphrates and the Nile delta. Despite earlier attempts to create a direct rail connection, the difference in railway gauges between the Ottoman and former British networks halted all efforts. No more!
OTT_Redraw_the_Vilayets코0=Redraw the Vilayets
OTT_Redraw_the_Vilayets_desc코0=Following the example of Anatolia, an extensive look at the provincial organisation of our new lands is essential to ensure proper integration and modernisation. Therefore we need to step away from the old Vilayet model and carve it up into smaller, more manageable provinces.
OTT_Settle_Sudanese_Issue코0=Settle the Sudanese Affair
OTT_Settle_Sudanese_Issue_desc코0=The question of Sudan’s future has for a while now bothered the government in Kostantiniyye, as unlike Egypt, there is very little connection between it and the Ottoman centre. The distance further complicates affairs as any effective communication is basically impossible. Therefore the idea now on the table proposes the creation of a separate Sudanese state tightly bound to the Porte.
OTT_Conference_Alexandria코0=Conference of Alexandria
OTT_Conference_Alexandria_desc코0=The current policy of imposed Turkish rule based on our demographic advantage no longer holds true now that the scales have been tipped in favour of the Arabs. This realisation has made many Turkish nationalists redefine their target audience and work towards a more inclusive citizen model. Therefore the Conference of Alexandria has been opened to finally cement the definition of an 'Ottoman' citizen.
OTT_Integrate_State_Monopolies코0=Integrate State Monopolies
OTT_Integrate_State_Monopolies_desc코0=Whilst the Egyptian state didn't include many industrial centres, it nonetheless boasts an impressive agricultural output. Through a system of landowners and Fellahs, a small group close to the crown was able to achieve tremendous power. The time has now come for us to take over these monopolies and integrate them within our own state holdings, as such breaking the power of the Egyptian aristocracy.
OTT_Recreate_Ottoman_Fifth_Army코0=Standardise Ottoman Army
OTT_Recreate_Ottoman_Fifth_Army_desc코0=Although Ottoman policy makes recruitment a non-ethnic/non-religious affair and imposes a draft for all males of age to serve in times of need, the last few wars have proven the reliance of our high command on Turkish recruits as they fear a fifth element in the Christian and Arab population. If we are to exert control over Egypt, this policy will need to be adjusted and an expanded army instated.
OTT_Elevate_Arab_Language코0=Elevate the Status of the Arab Language
OTT_Elevate_Arab_Language_desc코0=After the Weltkrieg and prompted by the Arab movement, Mehmet VI lifted some of the restrictions on the Arab language and made it the second (official) language of the Empire in Arab majority territories. Nonetheless, various institutions such as the military have remained solely Turkish and have caused great consternation from our Arab brethren. The time for full equality has arrived!
OTT_Expansion_Ottoman_Parliament코0=Expand the Meclis-i Umumî
OTT_Expansion_Ottoman_Parliament_desc코0=The Meclis-i Umumî or the General Assembly serves as the centre of power within our realm and has sole authority over matters of state. With Egypt still under questionable control, this chamber has thus far remained limited to Mashriqi and Anatolian parliamentarians as to avoid trouble with the re-integration. With the first hurdles behind us however, it is time to expand membership to our new subjects.

### Foreign Policy
OTT_Policy_of_Deterence코0=Policy of Deterrence
OTT_Policy_of_Deterence_desc코0=Too many Ottoman lives have been lost in the dreadful Weltkrieg for us to risk entanglement in a second conflict of the same scope. We should focus inwards and protect what we have, instead of throwing it all away in a fool’s gambit for glory and prestige.

OTT_Relinquish_European_Ambitions코0=Relinquish European Ambitions
OTT_Relinquish_European_Ambitions_desc코0=From an empire centred around 'Rumelia' and the Aegean, wherein the Mashriq and Anatolia was merely the periphery, a drastic shift has occurred in the direction of Anatolia proper. Through wars and the massive population shifts that occurred due to them, we have transformed into a 'Middle Eastern' and Muslim state. Europe is not our enemy and we should make sure they don't see us as such.
OTT_Greek_Turkish_Population_Exchange코0=The Greco-Turkish Accords
OTT_Greek_Turkish_Population_Exchange_desc코0=When the Balkan Wars finally ended, the once tightly intertwined ethnic and religious tapestry of the Empire found itself in disarray. Hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees flooded in from the Balkans whilst in Anatolia the remaining Christians were eyed with increasing suspicion. To solve this, we believe that an exchange between the remainders of both groups will prove effective and provide a détente to the hostile relations between ourselves and the Greek government.
OTT_Balkan_Military_Accords코0=Balkan Military Accords
OTT_Balkan_Military_Accords_desc코0=To prevent further war in the Balkans, our government proposes the creation of the so-called 'Edirne Accords' which would pose limitations on the size of our armies and increase economic activity across our borders. With greater exchange of goods and ideas over these loosened borders, it is hoped that escalation towards war will become much less likely.
OTT_Never_Another_Balkan_War코0=Peace at Home, Peace in the World
OTT_Never_Another_Balkan_War_desc코0='Osmanlı Halk Fırkası'nın müstakar umumî siyasetini şu kısa cümle açıkça ifadeye kâfidir zannederim: Yurtta sulh, cihanda sulh için çalışıyoruz.' - Mustafa Kemal Pasha\n('To describe the stable and general diplomatic policy of the Ottoman People's Party, I think this short sentence is enough: We work for peace at home, peace in the world.' - Mustafa Kemal Pasha)

OTT_Promote_Muslim_Solidarity코0=Promote Muslim Solidarity
OTT_Promote_Muslim_Solidarity_desc코0=The Ummah consists of hundreds of millions of Muslims all united in their common belief for Islamic values. Nonetheless, this community has waged war on itself for over a millennium, and has in the last few hundred years devolved into nothing but a play ball in the hands of the West. We should not blindly strive to enter the Western club but works towards a better, stronger Ummah.
OTT_United_Against_Imperialism코0=United against Imperialism
OTT_United_Against_Imperialism_desc코0=As there was no unified front against the Imperialists, one by one the proud Muslim states fell to the claws of European colonialism. We, as the predominant Muslim power in the world, and the centre of the Sunni faith, should see it as our duty to assist our brethren of the faith, protect them and show that the spirit of the Ummah has not yet been extinguished.
OTT_Maghrebi_Frontier코0=Reaffirm Ties with Maghreb
OTT_Maghrebi_Frontier_desc코0=From Morocco to the former Ottoman regencies of Algiers, Tunis and Tripolitania, the Maghrebis are held dear in the heart of our government and suffering the hardest from the effects of colonialism. We shall work together to secure a free and strong Maghreb!
OTT_Oriental_Cooperation코0=Cooperation with the Orient
OTT_Oriental_Cooperation_desc코0=For decades the Ottoman Empire has fostered relations with our distant brethren of the Orient. From the deserts and mountains of East Turkestan to the plains of Central Asia and the Indian lowlands, our brethren are ready to stand together in these troubling times.
OTT_Security_on_the_Arab_Peninsula코0=Stability on the Arab Peninsula
OTT_Security_on_the_Arab_Peninsula_desc코0=Home of Islam, the Arab peninsula forms the centrepiece of any attempt to bring the Ummah closer together. After years of piecemeal dissection by the British, the time has come to provide the struggling economies of the Gulf and the Bedouin of the interior with a real answer to their trouble!
OTT_Islamic_Economic_Union코0=Association of Muslim Nations
OTT_Islamic_Economic_Union_desc코0=Envisioned as a bloc of mutual prosperity, the Association of Muslim Nations would be an economic alliance with a goal reducing the reliance on European and American goods whilst also boosting domestic industrialisation efforts of the various participating members. If we all bind together, we can't be picked off one by one and exert a certain pressure on the powers that be.

OTT_Abolish_Full_Neutrality코0=Abolish Full Neutrality
OTT_Abolish_Full_Neutrality_desc코0=We should not kid ourselves any longer. The world is at war and the time for choosing has arrived. We could remain on the sidelines and watch as all sides plunge themselves into despair but then we would also have to contend ourselves with having no allies, no partners and an insecure future in the post-war world. Do we really want to risk that?
OTT_Gamble_in_the_Caucasus코0=Gamble in the Caucasus
OTT_Gamble_in_the_Caucasus_desc코0=The Germans may have snubbed us out of Azerbaijan during the last war but with tensions rising across the globe, we have an opportunity to play hard-ball and put the return of Azerbaijan as the cost for our partnership in their international venture.
OTT_Settling_Old_Disputes코0=Settling Old Disputes
OTT_Settling_Old_Disputes_desc코0=There is a time for hurting and a time for healing. With the debt owed to us now finally rectified, the time for healing has arrived. We should let bygones be bygones and work towards a closer friendship with our German allies.
OTT_Research_Cooperation코0=Ottoman-German Research Initiative
OTT_Research_Cooperation_desc코0=Ottoman scientific expertise is severely lacking as for one the literacy rate of the Empire is abominable. Furthermore, the Empire was never really able to catch up with the west in terms of military development and has since mostly relied on imported goods. Through our newfound connections to the German Empire, we can both access better equipment and educate our own people for the future.
OTT_Vanguard_in_the_South코0=Vanguard in the South
OTT_Vanguard_in_the_South_desc코0=Just like Belgium in the West and Lithuania in the East, we form Germany's Southern frontier and are as such tasked with an important role in guaranteeing their possessions in the region. From geographical features such as the Suez to the Caucasus to strategic ones such as the Oil fields of Iraq and the Chromite mines of Anatolia, we are an invaluable cog in the great machine of the Kaiser.
OTT_Alliance_of_Convenience코0=An Alliance of Convenience
OTT_Alliance_of_Convenience_desc코0=The Balkans need a firm hand to guide them back on track and end the constant conflict. Our former arch-nemesis in Vienna has similar ideas and might be tempted into forming a bloc to ensure that those are put into action. Furthermore we both share an aversion to the hawkish nature of German meddling and would preferably ward off Russian expansion. Shouldn't we put the past behind us then?
OTT_Sarajevo_Accords코0=Sign the Sarajevo Accords
OTT_Sarajevo_Accords_desc코0=Although for many an unexpected turn of events, the two former enemies of the Ottoman and Habsburg Empires have found similarities in their foreign policy and have decided to join forces in a defensive bloc aimed to ward off aggression from the North, West and East.

### Army
OTT_ottoman_army코0=The Ottoman Army
OTT_ottoman_army_desc코0=The Ottoman Army is the heart of the Turkish nation. We must seek to strengthen and support it against our numerous enemies, for the survival of our State depends on the Ever-Triumphant Horde.
OTT_army_modernization코0=Inspectorate of Army Modernisation
OTT_army_modernization_desc코0=Mauser rifles and bayonets proved effective in the Weltkrieg, but the battlefield is changing. The large gap between enemy technologies and our equipment is ever-expanding, and we must expend considerable effort if we want our army to retain its might.
OTT_modern_equipment코0=Standardise Military Equipment
OTT_modern_equipment_desc코0=Although the Ottoman army is undoubtedly the best equipped force in the entire Middle East, there is nonetheless a massive issue with regards to standardisation with many rifles, artillery pieces and other tools coming from a wide array of manufacturers. This diversity has led to significant strain on our supply lines, further complicated by the unreliability of many of its former owners engulfed by socialist strife. 
OTT_armor_effort_unq코0=Ottoman Armoured Project
OTT_armor_effort_unq_desc코0=Although the army is no stranger to armoured vehicles, sporting a variety of armoured cars during the Weltkrieg and taking command over a variety of Mark V tanks from the British Empire, the empire nonetheless lacks the capabilities of an established armoured corps. To rectify this issue, a special commission has been tasked with expanding our supply of armoured vehicles and providing adequate training.
OTT_directorate_military코0=Directorate of Military Factories
OTT_directorate_military_desc코0=We must reorganise our military production facilities into a proper network of organised factories. Establishing the Askeri Fabrikalar Umum Müdürlüğü will ensure that well coordinated orders are directed to our various domestic weapons manufacturers and the troops from the Hejaz to Gallipoli are well supplied.
OTT_edok코0=Restructure the Erkân-ı Harbiye Mektebi
OTT_edok_desc코0=The Erkân-ı Harbiye Mektebi or Ottoman Military College serves as the crowning achievement in the education of the officers of the army and is destined to give ample preparation to the best students who have climbed the ranks of our system. Nonetheless the college is in dire need of restructuring as the curricula have seen little change since the Weltkrieg and are in regards to combined arms severely lacking.
OTT_army_engineers코0=Army Engineer Schools
OTT_army_engineers_desc코0=Founded in 1795 under the reign of Selim III, the Mühendishâne-i Berrî-i Hümâyun serves as one of the most crucial schools in the empire, providing an expansive education into both civil and military engineering. Although the school was temporarily closed during the war as its students joined the army, it has been reopened after the war and expanded with an artillery education school in Anatolia.
OTT_desert_forces코0=Specialised Desert Regiments
OTT_desert_forces_desc코0=Although several attempts had been made already to set up specialised regiments in Libya and Central Arabia consisting of Bedouin and local tribesmen, these operations usually only lasted a few years. This was to change after the Weltkrieg as a new impetus to defend the Southern frontier led to the creation of the Iraqi Camel Corps, a practice that was soon to be imitated all across the Middle East.
OTT_Mass_Production코0=Maximise Military Production
OTT_Mass_Production_desc코0=Back in the day, the arsenals of the Sublime Porte were revered all across Europe, which cowered before the might of the unstoppable Turkish armies. These days are long behind us however as the Empire never quite caught the train of industrialisation, and the once grand arsenals fell silent. This is soon to change however as a new budget for the armed forces has made room for significant investments.
OTT_Specialised_Equipment코0=Diversify Military Portfolio
OTT_Specialised_Equipment_desc코0=The capacity of our domestic armament industry is pitiful at best, as many of the modern tools of warfare are currently left to foreign manufacturing concerns. If we are to arm our troops with something better than rifles, grenades and a uniform we will have to drastically diversify our manufacturing capacities.

### Air
OTT_army_aviation_unq코0=Army Aviation Command
OTT_army_aviation_unq_desc코0=We have a need for a better air force to support our ground forces. Let us take the time to reorganise the command structure of the Army Aviation Command to promote good officers and ensure that we can recruit the best pilots.
OTT_air_warfare_academy코0=Expand the Tayyare Mektebi
OTT_air_warfare_academy_desc코0=The \"Tayyare Mektebi\" is the first place our new pilots go to train: It is a flight school after all. We must procure better funding, newer facilities, and more capable instructors in order to create a new generation of amazing pilots.
OTT_aircraft_industry코0=Hürkuş & TOMTAS Aviation
OTT_aircraft_industry_desc코0=Vecihi Hürkuş was the first aviation engineer we ever had, and he served with distinction in the Weltkrieg. With his help we have developed a proper factory dedicated specifically to the development of new aircraft: Tayyare and Motor Türk Anonim Şirketi. With this modern factory we shall build planes that are the envy of the world.

### Naval
OTT_Naval_Program코0=Continue the Ottoman Naval Project
OTT_Naval_Program_desc코0=Our navy has never been spectacular, and many times efforts to improve and modernise the navy have been put on hold for more pressing concerns. Not anymore. Now we shall see to the creation of a grand fleet to eclipse any we have built before!
OTT_Shipbuilding_Effort코0=Golcuk Dockyards
OTT_Shipbuilding_Effort_desc코0=On the coast of the Sea of Marmara lies the town of Gölcük and the nearby naval base of the same name. The naval base needs to be paired with a new dry dock and supporting facilities in order for us to build and refit better ships.
OTT_Upgrade_Dreadnoughts코0=Refit our Dreadnoughts
OTT_Upgrade_Dreadnoughts_desc코0=The average person looks upon the visage of a dreadnought and is consumed with fear. Unable to approach the situation tactically they bemoan how difficult it is to sink a dreadnought. Ours need some upgrades and refits to bring them up to modern standards, and they will smash everyone they go up against!
OTT_Dominance_Black_Sea코0=Black Sea Shore Defences
OTT_Dominance_Black_Sea_desc코0=Although many see our navy as a force to dominate the Eastern Mediterranean, we must also be concerned with the Black Sea. One way we can strengthen our position on this front will be with a strong network of shore defences to blow enemy ships out of the water.
OTT_Basra_Kuwait코0=Expand the Basra-Kuwait Facilities
OTT_Basra_Kuwait_desc코0=Even less thought about than the Black Sea is The Persian Gulf. We DO in fact have a naval base there, and the ability to put a fleet in those waters and beyond. We should take the time to modernise the Basra-Kuwait facilities in case we are needed in the Gulf.
OTT_Naval_Academy코0=Imperial School of Naval Sciences
OTT_Naval_Academy_desc코0=With all of these projects completed recently there is a growing sense that we can do more. We can have a larger and better navy not through copying other nations, but by innovating ourselves! We shall grant greater funding and resources to the School of Naval Sciences to help become the most modern navy in the world!

### Economic (Kemalist)
OTT_Samsun_Iktisat_Kongresi코0=The Samsun Iktisat Kongresi
OTT_Samsun_Iktisat_Kongresi_desc코0=Following the First Economic Congress in Izmir, we will host a second grand event to showcase the progress and capabilities of the Sublime Porte. As the world economy spirals out of control following the collapse of the Berlin stock exchange, this congress will be used as a way to calm down investors and showcase the stability of our internal market.
OTT_Raise_Import_Tariffs코0=Raise Import Tariffs
OTT_Raise_Import_Tariffs_desc코0=To encourage domestic industry and prevent reliance on foreign construction materials and basic consumer goods, the government will raise import tariffs substantially. Although this is a great boon for the nascent Anatolian industry, many in Beirut, Alexandretta and Haifa fear that this will greatly damage their status as gateways to the Orient.
OTT_Restrict_Foreign_Exchange_Regime코0=Restrict Foreign Exchange Regime
OTT_Restrict_Foreign_Exchange_Regime_desc코0=Lack of confidence in the Ottoman government has pushed many investors to sell off their Liras in favour of foreign currencies in recent months, to the detriment of its value. By restricting our domestic investors' capacity to sell off their Lira's we can strengthen our currency compared to the leading currencies of the world like the Mark.
OTT_Quantity_Restrictions_Import코0=Impose Quantity Restrictions on Import
OTT_Quantity_Restrictions_Import_desc코0=Whilst the government aims to create a strong local industry, it too often finds itself relying on goods imported from the Donau-monarchy or the German Empire. Steel, machinery, chemicals, etc. are all imported which makes us not only reliant on those nations, but greatly hampers domestic goods as they can't compete with the cheap export products of the larger manufactures abroad.
OTT_Ziraat_Bankasi_Credit코0=Ziraat Bankasi Credit Program
OTT_Ziraat_Bankasi_Credit_desc코0=Originally the brainchild of Midhat Pasha, the Memleket Sandığı was reorganised into the Ziraat Bankasi in 1888. Providing stability and relief for farmers, still the majority of our population, the bank has been greatly expanded over the years. As prices for agricultural goods are in flux, following the collapse of Ukrainian and German markets, the vast reserves of the bank will be used to fight the crisis.
OTT_Toprak_Mahsulleri_Ofisi코0=Open the Toprak Mahsulleri Ofisi
OTT_Toprak_Mahsulleri_Ofisi_desc코0=According to Law No 3491, this agency will prevent abnormal decrease or increase of the wheat prices against producers and consumers, to protect and regulate the wheat industry, to import or export wheat when necessary, to monitor wheat production trends and market movements in the world, to establishing milling facilities and bakeries in locations to be determined and to carry on other similar tasks.
OTT_Balance_the_Budget코0=Balance the Budget
OTT_Balance_the_Budget_desc코0=When the Ottoman Empire collapsed under the strain of the debts it had racked up during the Crimean War, an international organisation called the OPDA (Ottoman Public Debt Administration) essentially took over our economy. The disgrace and damage it has caused remain a vibrant memory in the minds of many Turkish economists, who since have sworn to maintain a balanced budget at all cost.
OTT_Years_of_Progress코0=Four Years of Progress
OTT_Years_of_Progress_desc코0=Inspired in part by socialist systems, the cabinet of our Grand Vizier will decree the next 4-year plan which he has dubbed the 'Four Years of Progress'. With the focus on rapid industrialisation of the Ottoman nation, it wants to greatly reduce the reliance on foreign goods and expand the domestic industry targeting textiles, steel, cement and others.
OTT_Economic_Commisions코0=Fourteen Economic Commissions
OTT_Economic_Commisions_desc코0=Whilst the Ottoman Empire has seen a distinct rise in its industrial capacity and a reduction in dependence on agricultural exports, the empire lacks a clear vision to really guide the nation towards the future. To fix that, the government has decreed the creation of 14 economic commissions, each with their own areas, to formulate a centralised plan for the future.
OTT_Striving_for_Autarky코0=Striving for Autarky
OTT_Striving_for_Autarky_desc코0=With the global market heavily in flux after its share of disasters in the last few decades, many economists in the empire have started to push for ‘autarky’, or economic self-sufficiency. Although the empire has a long way to go, deriving mainly from its lack of a large industrial base, plans for cement, steel, textile, etc. factories have already been approved by the economic commissions.
OTT_Anatolian_Industrialisation코0=Second Anatolian Industrialisation
OTT_Anatolian_Industrialisation_desc코0=Although the National Economy scheme has already led to the development of much young industry in Anatolia, the government sees much room for improvement in what was only 30 years ago one of the poorer regions of the empire. A variety of industries in construction, tobacco, textile, etc. will serve as the backbone of this new project.
OTT_Sumerbank코0=Sümerbank Investments
OTT_Sumerbank_desc코0=The cornerstone of the OHF industrialisation model, the Sümerbank serves as the primary investor and controller of our rapidly expanding industrial assets. Although it has a hand in most sectors of the 4-Year Plan, its primary focus is on the development of the Turkish Textile industry which after initial successes in Anatolia has been expanded to Homs.
OTT_Lebanese_Industrialisation코0=Beiruti Industrial Zone
OTT_Lebanese_Industrialisation_desc코0=The economic motor of Syria and its primary harbour, the city of Beirut serves an important role in the industrialisation of the Mashriq and also in further centralising authority. Although some have proposed to shift focus more to Damascus or Homs, both established agricultural and manufacturing centres, the government has proven adamant in its focus on Lebanon, supposedly to break the power of Damascus.
OTT_Model_Farm_Project코0=Expand the Model Farm Project
OTT_Model_Farm_Project_desc코0=Created during Kemal's first term, the Orman Çiftliği or Forest Farm was set up near Ankara as a private farm but was quickly developed into a "model farm" which by using the most modern forms of agriculture was to serve as a tool to teach the Anatolian farmers new methods. With matters in the capital taking most of the Vizier's time, the project is on the verge of being transferred to the government.
OTT_Aleppan_Institute_Technology코0=Aleppan Institute of Technology
OTT_Aleppan_Institute_Technology_desc코0=Although a variety of schools already exist to cater to the Arab population, the only real institutes of technological higher learning are on the West Coast of Anatolia, primarily in the capital. To solve the issue of technical illiteracy of large swathes of our population, making them useless to our industrialisation schemes, Aleppo will be the home of a new engineering institute.
OTT_Monopolise_Railway_Companies코0=Monopolise the Railway Companies
OTT_Monopolise_Railway_Companies_desc코0=The 'DDUM' or State Railways Administration was founded after the war to take over Entente railway concessions, and to finance the construction of further railroads across the Empire. Nonetheless many foreign concessions remained and various privately held tracks refused integration. With the crisis however, many of these companies are on the brink of bankruptcy, opening the way for unification.
OTT_Eastern_Anatolian_Project코0=Eastern Anatolian Railway Project
OTT_Eastern_Anatolian_Project_desc코0=Just like the Americans conquered the Frontier through the iron beasts of the industrial era, so has our government decreed the expansion of rail and other roads into Eastern Anatolia. Around these railroads would then be created a system of villages and towns inhabited by Turks or immigrants of both the Balkans and the Caucasus to strengthen the hold of Kostantiniyye over their own "Frontier".
OTT_Three_Blacks_Project코0=Three Blacks Project
OTT_Three_Blacks_Project_desc코0=Centred around three of the main industrial resources (coal, iron and oil), the three blacks project aims to expand domestic production to the point that the Ottoman Empire is capable of being self-sufficient. To achieve this goal, the universities of the Empire have in cooperation with institutes all across Europe worked towards the refinement of extraction methods and the exploration of new sites.
OTT_Zonguldak_Mining코0=Zonguldak Coal Mining
OTT_Zonguldak_Mining_desc코0=Already discovered in the 19th century, the coal mines of Zonguldak nonetheless saw little exploitation during most of the century and it was only with the Weltkrieg and the sudden need of coal for the Ottoman fleet that Zonguldak started to assert itself as an important economic centre. With the government plans for domestic steel production in Karabük, Zonguldak is to play a key role.
OTT_Trans_Mashriqi_Pipeline코0=Finish the Trans-Mashriqi Pipeline
OTT_Trans_Mashriqi_Pipeline_desc코0=With the exploitation of Iraqi oil proceeding at an ever-increasing pace, hard limits have started to occur as the capacity of shipping in Southern Iraq and the increasingly hostile relations with Teheran have been identified as difficult hurdles to cross. Furthermore since our clients are located in Europe, plans have been drafted to connect the fields of Kirkuk to the ports of Iskenderun and Beirut.
OTT_Tigris_Program코0=Tigris Development Scheme
OTT_Tigris_Program_desc코0=This bustling river is one of the most important natural features of the Middle East, bringing life to otherwise arid deserts and providing an ideal way of communication and transportation. Furthermore, it's not solely an Iraqi river, but also leaves a deep impression on Kurdistan, Anatolia and Syria. By focusing our efforts on this vein, the government hopes to strengthen these *Ottoman* bonds.
OTT_TPC_Kirkuk코0=TPC Kirkuk Operations
OTT_TPC_Kirkuk_desc코0=With exploitation starting in the '20s, the oil fields of Kirkuk have seen rapid expansion by the TPC as increasing government control over the company and a direct need of new revenue for the state has pushed its growth to the max. Nonetheless the vast reserves have only started to be touched and with America in disarray, the government has identified these as essential to the future of the Ottoman state.
OTT_Lower_Mesopotamian_Exploration코0=Southern Iraqi Oil Exploration
OTT_Lower_Mesopotamian_Exploration_desc코0=Although most operations of the TPC and its German-Dutch allies are centred around Kirkuk and Mosul in the North of Iraq, large untapped reserves have recently been discovered in the South of Iraq, near the important harbours of Basra and Kuwait. Since these are also already tightly connected to the Iraqi rail network, TPC has requested a concession from the Porte to expand operations throughout Iraq.
OTT_Basra_Concessions코0=Sell off Basra Concessions
OTT_Basra_Concessions_desc코0=Although a large part of the Basra vilayet was given in concession to the British Empire after the Weltkrieg, many of these ran out of time and were forced to be turned back over to the Ottoman government. Although the government has thus far refrained from offering them up for sale, to protect its own Kirkuk production, they could help reinvigorate the Iraqi economy.

### Political (Fevzi)
OTT_State_of_Emergency코0=State of Emergency
OTT_State_of_Emergency_desc코0=The assassination of the Grand Vizier has shown that the Ottoman state is held captive by radical Islamist extremists, opposed to the unstoppable tide of progress and unwilling to recognise the decay of Ottoman power. We cannot give in to their lack of reason, and as such have to take any measures necessary to ensure the dream of the CUP and OHF remains intact!
OTT_Replace_Walis코0=Recall the Walis
OTT_Replace_Walis_desc코0=Complacency and a lack of enthusiasm amongst the ruling cadre has steadily led to a decrease in quality and ability of our Walis or governors. If the Ottoman state is to prosper, these corrupt, decadent and unscrupulous individuals have to been torn out and replaced by those loyal to the regime and its grand vision for the future!
OTT_Abolish_Mecelle_Fevzi코0=Abolish the Mecelle Code
OTT_Abolish_Mecelle_Fevzi_desc코0=Following the suggestions made by the Judicial Commission, the time has finally come to rid ourselves of the Mecelle. A new civil code, fully secular in nature, will treat all Ottoman citizens as equals and will show the desire to tear down the last conservative anchor points.
OTT_Reform_the_Millet_System코0=Reform the Millet System
OTT_Reform_the_Millet_System_desc코0=The Millet System was a creation to ensure that Ottoman citizens who did not practice the Islamic faith could govern themselves, and as such, limit sectarian conflict. This has over the years however led to non-Muslim citizens almost completely detaching themselves from the Empire, and has encouraged the disaster that followed in the Balkans. With a new Civil Code, surely this system is no longer necessary?
OTT_Confiscate_Privy_Purse_Holdings코0=Confiscate the Privy Purse Holdings
OTT_Confiscate_Privy_Purse_Holdings_desc코0=Although the power of the monarchy has seen a steady decline these last few decades under the supervision of ambitious party figures, the crown is still the direct owner of vast swathes of the empire and uses these lands for their own benefit and enrichment. That they are depriving the state of resources in a state of crisis should be unacceptable and will only fund the religious extremists.
OTT_Marechal_Nous_Voila코0=\"Mareşal biz buradayız!\"
OTT_Marechal_Nous_Voila_desc코0='Marshal, here we are!' has steadily developed to be a catchphrase amongst allies of the military regime who see in the great Fevzi Pasha the saviour of the Kemalist dream and a bulwark of stability and prosperity against both religious extremists and socialist revolutionaries.
OTT_Expand_the_Military_Rusdiye코0=Expand the Military Rüşdiye
OTT_Expand_the_Military_Rusdiye_desc코0=The Rüşdiye were a sort of High School set up as part of the Tanzimat reforms in 1845 to provide for education in the European style. Besides these schools however a variety of military preparatory schools were set up in Anatolia and Iraq to install a disciplined and patriotic spirit into the students. These schools are now the target of education reform, aimed at further strengthening the loyalty to the state.
OTT_Consolidate_Military_Dictatorship코0=Consolidate the Military Dictatorship
OTT_Consolidate_Military_Dictatorship_desc코0=Even though the Marshal supports the notion of democracy, and initially planned an immediate return to parliamentary rule, he has steadily grown disillusioned with the political establishment. Seeing them as a disease weakening the empire from the inside, perfidious voices all around him have urged the Marshal to maintain military rule on the state until we can be absolutely sure our interests are safe.
OTT_Lift_State_of_Emergency코0=Lift the State of Emergency
OTT_Lift_State_of_Emergency_desc코0=Although the Marshal has shown his clear disgust for the weakness of the decentralists which has led to the crisis the empire only recently has been plummeted in, he still supports the notion of democracy and with the nation stabilised and the economy recovering, he has in cooperation with various political figures decided to hand power back to the establishment and lift the state of emergency.

OTT_Enshrine_Endeavour_Front코0=Enshrine the 'Endeavour Front'
OTT_Enshrine_Endeavour_Front_desc코0=Including key politicians from all factions, both decentralist and centralist, this 'Endeavour' front strives to provide a stable transitional government until all foreign threats have abated and the internal situation has been pacified. Consisting largely of military figures loyal to either the OHF or DF, the front nonetheless also includes various Arabs and other minorities to ensure a lasting peace.
OTT_Centralise_State_Authority코0=Centralise State Authority
OTT_Centralise_State_Authority_desc코0=It is only through strong central authority that the far-flung regions of the empire can be kept safe and secure. That the decentralists believe we should give in to nationalist and autonomist movements is an outrage and will only lead to the collapse of the Ottoman state and its further dismemberment by foreign vultures.
OTT_Lift_Maintenance_Public_Order_Decree코0=Lift the Maintenance of Public Order Decree
OTT_Lift_Maintenance_Public_Order_Decree_desc코0=Enacted during the aftermath of the political chaos that has gripped us these last few years, the decree served well in enabling emergency measures and swift retribution throughout the lands. As the threat abates however and the foreign threat relinquishes, there is no longer any need for such extreme measures.
OTT_Disband_Trials_Progress코0=Disband the Tribunals of Progress
OTT_Disband_Trials_Progress_desc코0=Having served their goal in the eradication of domestic terrorist organisations and vicious plots, the feared military tribunals will be closed down and normal law and order will retake its rightful position in Ottoman society.
OTT_Cooperate_Private_Sector코0=Cooperate with the Private Sector
OTT_Cooperate_Private_Sector_desc코0=An alliance of the public and private sector, the new OHF is toning down its étatist rhetoric in favour of closer cooperation with the capitalists and landholders of the Ottoman Empire. No one better to symbolise this marriage than Mahmud Celal Bey who after a successful career in the banking sector will now cooperate with the party into drafting a new economic plan.
OTT_Vilayet_Reorganisation코0=Reorganise the Vilayet System
OTT_Vilayet_Reorganisation_desc코0=The current size of our Vilayets is far too large, and as such encourage concentration of power within local figures. By reducing the size of them and through the expansion of our telegraph and radio network, we can make them more dependent on the capital and have less power to mismanage.
OTT_Emancipation_Vanguard_FEV코0=Emancipation Vanguard
OTT_Emancipation_Vanguard_FEV_desc코0=Through the co-education act, we have laid the first bricks on the road to emancipation. Nonetheless this is only the beginning as the OHF now also plans to enable women to run for office and vote in the national elections. A variety of professions will also be opened up to women as the war has shown the chronic lack of labour force amongst the Anatolian people.
OTT_Millet_Mektepleri_FEV코0=Millet Mektepleri
OTT_Millet_Mektepleri_FEV_desc코0=The Millet Mektepleri or Nation School is the brainchild of Minister of Education Mustafa Necati and has a grand aim to make the entire Ottoman population literate. Focusing on the age bracket 14-45, these 'schools' are compulsory for all citizens including women and prisoners. After completing a test, the participants will be granted a certificate from the state and join the Modern Ottoman society.
OTT_Incorporate_Kadroist_Movement코0=Incorporate the Kadroist Movement
OTT_Incorporate_Kadroist_Movement_desc코0=Based on the writings of the 'Kadro' paper, there has been a push by the radicalists within the OHF to follow the example of European nations and discard with the notion of a liberal parliamentary democracy as the ideal. Striving for populism, heavy state control and the creation of a vanguard to lift up the ignorant masses, their message is finding a welcoming ear amongst the squabbling OHF elite.
OTT_Committee_Inquest코0=Establish the Committee of Inquest
OTT_Committee_Inquest_desc코0=As the threat to our government remains real, the party has decided to enact emergency measures in the shape of the Tahkikat komisyonu (Committee of Inquest). This committee, consisting solely of OHF hardliners, has been organised like a court with the power to imprison any perceived threat to the state. Other political parties have also been dismantled with their leaders tried by the new Committee whilst the press is silenced.
OTT_Nationalise_Basic_Industries코0=Nationalise the Basic Industries
OTT_Nationalise_Basic_Industries_desc코0=Although the Kemalists made massive strides in their plans to bring the state economy under government control, they have clearly not gone far enough. All basic industries, tobacco, textile, minerals, oil, banks and much more are to be immediately brought under government commissions which will determine the new, better, course of the Ottoman economy.
OTT_Social_Nationalism코0=Embrace Social Nationalism
OTT_Social_Nationalism_desc코0=Where Western society was already too late and where Russia struggled, the Ottoman Empire provides a solution to the issue of the bourgeoisie. Strongly believing that the empire does not yet have a well established middle and upper class (although many disagree), the Kadroists believe that it is the perfect place to work towards a classless society wherein all can be truly equal, united behind the banner of the Sublime Porte.
OTT_Enact_Separation_Church_State코0=Enact the Separation of Church and State
OTT_Enact_Separation_Church_State_desc코0=If the Empire is ever to advance towards a secular institution, we have to take decisive action against the various religious organisations shouting their opposition to the reforms. The Sufi orders form the most significant hurdle in this as they not only de facto control Eastern Anatolia but have direct contacts with the Caliph who they utilise to remain in power. No more!
OTT_Union_Party_State코0=Fulfil the Union of Party and State
OTT_Union_Party_State_desc코0=Such as the populists in Russia have achieved, there can no longer be a difference between party and state. The party will from now on become the state and have the complete monopoly on any and all governmental matters. The Caliph, a puppet soon to be torn down, will be allowed to keep his crown but all reactionaries still standing will be brought to swift justice.
OTT_Encourage_Private_Initiative_FEV코0=Encourage Private Initiative
OTT_Encourage_Private_Initiative_FEV_desc코0=The concept of Private Initiative or teşebbüs-ü Şahsi serves most prominently in the discourse of Sabahattin whom has identified its lack as one of the main reasons for Ottoman decline. Based on the ideas of Demolin, the Vizier pleads for looking for achievement in yourself and self-confidence and not relying on family or state, supporting the notion of private ownership as crucial to the social and economic development of the empire.
OTT_Break_Up_State_Monopolies_FEV코0=Break up State Monopolies
OTT_Break_Up_State_Monopolies_FEV_desc코0=Although the DF largely pushes for a liberal agenda in the social sense, it is also no stranger to its economic ideals, and believes that the large state monopolies set up by the CUP and OHF the last few decades, have seriously hampered the economic growth of the Ottoman Empire. Stifling competition and innovation, the government now pushes for privatisation of these monopolies in an attempt to stimulate the free market.
OTT_Multi_Level_Democracy_FEV코0=Corruption Commissions
OTT_Multi_Level_Democracy_FEV_desc코0=Faith in Konstantinyye has been shattered as of late and with that a precipitous rise of extortion, tax-evasion, and bribery. The provincials have been neglected for far too long as the upper echelons of government have writhed with a revolving door of administrations. Now the state will make a bold push towards transparent governance and regardless of cost or effectiveness the people will be made to see our earnest commitment to cleaning up the provinces.
OTT_Imperial_Literacy_FEV코0=Imperial Literacy Campaign
OTT_Imperial_Literacy_FEV_desc코0=Education serves as the basis for any functional society, and the lack thereof can be identified as the root cause of our decline for "Living with personal effort needs much virtue. However, we do not have such qualities because of our raising and education style. We want to live without working, we demand wealth without giving effort therefore we aim to become civil servants at the state. Explicitly, our present poverty stems from our educational system.
OTT_Dismantle_Endeavour_Front코0=Dismantle the 'Endeavour Front'
OTT_Dismantle_Endeavour_Front_desc코0=As stability returns to the Ottoman Empire, the need for an all encompassing coalition has disappeared. With our policies these last few months decisively favouring one of the two main power blocs within the coalition, it is only normal that the Sultan will now appoint the leader of said faction as his new Grand Vizier. Let us pray that true and profound beliefs in democracy will finally be achieved.
OTT_Enshrine_Principles_People코0=Enshrine the Principles of the People
OTT_Enshrine_Principles_People_desc코0=Forming the core tenets of the Kemalist ideology, the principles of the people are based on the Chinese ideas but adapted to suit the Ottoman state. Populism, Nationalism, Statism and Reformism will from now until forever guide the Turkish people to an ever brighter future!
OTT_Statutes_of_Autonomy_FEV코0=Adopt Statutes of Personal Autonomy
OTT_Statutes_of_Autonomy_FEV_desc코0=Although a Federation model failed to materialize with the reintroduction of political democracy new momentum has been building for the cause of National Personal Autonomy. First decried as a new Millet System in fact these new self-organised bodies will be indifferent to geographic expression and be responsible for the education and cultural institutions of its members but still submit to the authority of the central government.
OTT_Join_Reichspakt_Fevzi코0=Join the Reichspakt
OTT_Join_Reichspakt_Fevzi_desc코0=Although relations with Berlin have cooled since the collapse of the Kemalist regime, we cannot deny that it is German military might that protects the Empire from the Russian bear, and despite concerns from pacifists, we have no choice but to recognise that if the Porte wishes to partake in the New World Order, we must stand united with the Germans in their time of need.
OTT_Join_Entente_Fevzi코0=Join the Entente
OTT_Join_Entente_Fevzi_desc코0=Despicable traitors to all Islam during the Weltkrieg, you will be hard-pressed to find a living soul willing to speak positively of the reactionary French slave state or their Anglo dogs, but, it cannot be denied that the geopolitical reality is leaving us with little choice. German might is crumbling and the clear industrial and military power of the United States may be all that's left to rebuke the Russian bear.
OTT_Join_Copro_Fevzi코0=Join the Co-prosperity Sphere
OTT_Join_Copro_Fevzi_desc코0=As the balance of power shifts from West to East and an alliance between American capital and Japanese spirit has been formed, the time has arrived for the Porte to also relinquish its ties to the old world. Standing strong with our Japanese friends and backed by the industrial might of the US of A, none will be able to oppose us!

### Foreign Policy (Fevzi)
OTT_Abolish_Full_Neutrality_Fevzi코0=Abolish Full Neutrality
OTT_Abolish_Full_Neutrality_Fevzi_desc코0=We should not kid ourselves any longer. The world is at war and the time for choosing has arrived. We could remain on the sidelines and watch as all sides plunge themselves into despair, but then we would also have to contend ourselves with having no allies, no partners and an insecure future in the post-war world. Do we really want to risk that?
OTT_Revise_German_Bilateral_Agreement코0=Revise the German Bilateral Agreement
OTT_Revise_German_Bilateral_Agreement_desc코0=Established already during the Weltkrieg and continued after, various agreements and trade deals between the German and Ottoman empires play a key role in the economy of the Sublime Porte. With war soon upon us and a clear lack of equipment noticeable within the armed forces, a proposal has been made to provide agricultural produce at lower prices in exchange for German military aid.
OTT_Increase_Ties_German_Empire코0=Reinforce Ties to Berlin
OTT_Increase_Ties_German_Empire_desc코0=As our former allies in the Weltkrieg, many in Turkey have maintained that a permanent alliance to the German state is in the best interests of both countries and have continually asked the OHF cabinets to work towards this goal. With the army now in charge, it seems the time has come to fully realise these plans and bind the two powers closer than ever before.
OTT_Embargo_the_Internationale코0=Embargo the Internationale
OTT_Embargo_the_Internationale_desc코0=Although the syndicalist bloc has not directly destabilised our state, lacking the educated population or unions to sway, it is however rapidly becoming clear that a confrontation will eventually be upon us, and it would be in our best interests to stick to the same marching order that the German Empire propagates.
OTT_Ottoman_German_Research_Fevzi코0=Ottoman-German Research Initiative
OTT_Ottoman_German_Research_Fevzi_desc코0=Ottoman scientific expertise is severely lacking, not least because the literacy rate of the Empire is abominable. Furthermore, the Empire was never really able to catch up with the west in terms of military development and has since mostly relied on imported goods. Through our newfound connections to the German Empire, we can both access better equipment and educate our own people for the future.
OTT_Vanguard_in_the_South_Fevzi코0=Vanguard in the South
OTT_Vanguard_in_the_South_Fevzi_desc코0=Just like Belgium in the West and Lithuania in the East, we form Germany's Southern frontier and are as such tasked with an important role in guaranteeing their possessions in the region. From geographical features such as the Suez to the Caucasus to strategic ones such as the Oil fields of Iraq and the Chromite mines of Anatolia, we are an invaluable cog in the great machine of the Kaiser.

### Political (Sabahattin)
OTT_Grand_Vizier_Sabahattin코0=Grand Vizier Sabahattin
OTT_Grand_Vizier_Sabahattin_desc코0=The most prominent Ottoman sociologist, Mehmed Sabâhaddin, has been appointed Grand Vizier by the Padishah. The prince who has had a tumultuous past, being forced into exile both under Abdulhamid II in 1899 and two CUP governments, returned after the political détente in the wake of the Great War and has asserted himself as the main force within the decentralist movement. With his appointment, it seems more than likely that he will finally push through his agenda.
OTT_Reform_the_Gendarmerie코0=Reform the Ottoman Gendarmerie
OTT_Reform_the_Gendarmerie_desc코0=After the abolition of the Janissary corps in the early 19th century, a variety of military organisations were established to ensure order and stability in the provinces of Rumelia and Anatolia. With the proclamation of the Tanzimat reforms in 1839, these organisations were combined into the Jandarma (Ottoman Gendarmerie). This organisation however suffers from an over-reliance on Turkish manpower in its upper cadres, making it a prime target for reform.
OTT_Break_Up_State_Monopolies코0=Break up State Monopolies
OTT_Break_Up_State_Monopolies_desc코0=Although the HIF primarily pushes for a liberal agenda in the social sense, it is also no stranger to its economic ideals, and believes that the large state monopolies set up by the CUP and OHF the last few decades, have seriously hampered the economic growth of the Ottoman Empire. Stifling competition and innovation, the government now pushes for privatisation of these monopolies in an attempt to stimulate the free market.
OTT_Encourage_Private_Initiative코0=Encourage Private Initiative
OTT_Encourage_Private_Initiative_desc코0=The concept of Private Initiative or teşebbüs-ü Şahsi serves most prominently in the discourse of Sabahattin whom has identified its lack as one of the main reasons for Ottoman decline. Based on the ideas of Demolin, the Vizier pleads for looking for achievement in yourself and self-confidence and not relying on family or state, supporting the notion of private ownership as crucial to the social and economic development of the empire.
OTT_Multi_Level_Democracy코0=Multi-Level Democracy
OTT_Multi_Level_Democracy_desc코0=Although Sabahattin originally did not plead for autonomy, his discourse of decentralisation almost solely found support amongst autonomist movements and various groups of landed elite. They, seeing the centralising state as a direct threat to their own status, support a system of multi-level democracy wherein not just the Chamber of Deputies but also Provincial Assemblies can be empowered to serve their local units.
OTT_Shift_Power_to_the_Provincial_Assembly코0=Shift Power to the Provincial Assemblies
OTT_Shift_Power_to_the_Provincial_Assembly_desc코0=With the creation of Provincial Assemblies a fact, the process of administrative reorganisation has commenced, shifting more and more authority away from the central government in favour of these local bodies. These assemblies, serving as quasi-mini-parliaments for the various regions of the Empire, will better cater to the local cultural and economic needs of the population, as such uplifting the empire as a whole.
OTT_Revise_the_Mecelle코0=Revise the Mecelle
OTT_Revise_the_Mecelle_desc코0=The civil code we have used since the Tanzimat era or the Mecelle code was first codified in 1877. Based on the Islamic Hanafi legal tradition, the code was the first enforcement of a unified law over all Ottoman citizens who previously according to the Millet system used their own codes. It nonetheless strongly favours the Sunni population of the empire, leading to demands from Christians and Shi'ites alike to replace it with a more modern equivalent.
OTT_Equality_before_the_Law코0=Equality before the Law
OTT_Equality_before_the_Law_desc코0=Although the Ottoman constitution dictates the equality before the law for all Ottoman groups, regardless of religion or ethnicity, the empire remains heavily biased towards its Muslim majority, whose rights are better protected and catered to in all sections of the Ottoman bureaucracy. The Mecelle, based on the Sharia, stands as a key pillar within this and will need strong revision if true equality is to be achieved.
OTT_Distribute_Miri_Land코0=Redistribute Miri Land
OTT_Distribute_Miri_Land_desc코0=Although the ideas of private land ownership were introduced into the Ottoman Empire during the 19th century and land redistribution was performed, large parts of the Empire still remain either state or direct royal property. This absence of private land tenure decreases production, which brings despotism since there is no cause for people to work. As the liberals believe that humanity needs freedom to succeed, we must open these lands to private individuals.
OTT_Repeal_Unification_Law코0=Repeal the Unification Decree
OTT_Repeal_Unification_Law_desc코0=The Unification and Co-education decree, a testament of OHF intentions to reform the state into a secular and modern society, is seen by many conservatives in our coalition as an insult to Islam itself, whilst many liberals see in its centralist approach to education an attack on the Millet system and the initiative of private individuals. Serving as the main election promise on which our coalition was built, its repeal is of the utmost essence.
OTT_Abolish_Senate코0=Abolish the Meclis-i Ayan
OTT_Abolish_Senate_desc코0=The Meclis-i Ayan, the Ottoman equivalent of the Senate, served little use in our political system, being primarily a way for the Padishah to place individuals favourable to his own ideas in positions which could overrule decisions made in the Chamber of Deputies. This extra weight, which only really served to grant excessive salaries to the elite, has been rendered useless as the combination of provincial and the central assemblies provide enough oversight without royal interference.
OTT_Imperial_Literacy_Campaign코0=Imperial Literacy Campaign
OTT_Imperial_Literacy_Campaign_desc코0=Education serves as the basis for any functional society, and the lack thereof can be identified as the root cause of our decline for "Living with personal effort needs much virtue. However, we do not have such qualities because of our raising and education style. We want to live without working, we demand wealth without giving effort therefore we aim to become civil servants at the state. Explicitly, our present poverty stems from our educational system.
OTT_Revise_Millet코0=Revise the Millet System
OTT_Revise_Millet_desc코0=Since the new Ottoman Civil Code already guarantees equality to all groups within the empire and the provincial assemblies already increase their say in affairs pertaining to their own culture or province, the need for the Millet system has been put into doubt as it currently only causes extra bureaucratic messiness and needless administrative levels.
OTT_The_Sublime_Federation코0=The Sublime Federation
OTT_The_Sublime_Federation_desc코0=Although Sabahattin was fiercely opposed to the creation of a federal model, the HIF has had no choice but to base their program on one of provincial autonomy, as its main supporters, consisting of minority groups, continue to push for more rights. Therefore, the creation of a federal Ottoman system has become unavoidable. This federation, led by the federal assembly and with the provincial assemblies serving as its sub-states, promises to improve the lives of every Ottoman.

### Political (Arslan)
OTT_Grand_Vizier_Arslan코0=Grand Vizier Arslan
OTT_Grand_Vizier_Arslan_desc코0=A Druze prince from the region of Lebanon, Shakib Arslan is well known in conservative circles as Amir al-Bayān ("Prince of Eloquence") and plays a key role in the islamist movement of the empire. Although it may be seen as shocking that a non-Turk was able to achieve the office of Grand Vizier, it is also a clear signal of Kostantiniyye that the growing Arab movement needs a powerful answer.
OTT_Promote_Panislamism코0=Promote Pan-Islamism
OTT_Promote_Panislamism_desc코0=Harking back to the origins of Islam itself, the idea of pan-Islamism was brought back to the forefront by the Ottoman sultans in the late 18th century, to exert influence over the Muslim subjects of the Czar, and to provide a metaphorical glue to the citizens of the Porte. Its greatest success can be found amongst the subjects of the Mashriq, as it ensured a degree of loyalty to the Sultan throughout the war that would likely have been reduced without the efforts of various Islamists
OTT_Jizya코0=Institute the Varlık Vergisi
OTT_Jizya_desc코0=The 'Varlık Vergisi' is a specific war tax which targets rich Armenians and Jews to fund the operations of the government. By putting exorbitant burdens on these groups, the policy both serves to remedy the ever-increasing deficit and to bolster the 'National Economy' by pushing the non-Muslims out of business and encourage take-overs by Muslim citizens.
OTT_Empower_Sheikh코0=Empower the Seyhülislam
OTT_Empower_Sheikh_desc코0=The role of the Şeyhülislam can best be understood as the Grand Mufti of all muslims within the Ottoman Empire. Residing over the Ulama, he is responsible for the writing of fatwas and ensures order and discipline within the religious hierarchy making him only second to the Caliph himself. Nonetheless his power was greatly hindered during the CUP regime as he was reduced to a tool to dweep the masses. This needs readjustment!
OTT_Religious_Education코0=Prioritise Religious Education
OTT_Religious_Education_desc코0=Fiercely opposed to the idea that religious education should take a backseat to the sciences, the education ministry has revised the complete curriculum and has inserted various traditional ideas and obligatory Islamic classes. Nonetheless, Arslan’s ideas do not condemn all forms of modernisation, and they do not refute that which science has proven. He speaks out against imitation of the West but recognises that there are lessons to be learned from them.
OTT_Revise_Constitution코0=Revise the Constitution
OTT_Revise_Constitution_desc코0=As Parliament continues to prove a thorn in our sight, the conservatives are now pushing for the restoration of the right to prorogue parliament without its permission and as such give the Sultan the power to push through the necessary reforms without parliamentary oversight. For after all, shouldn't the Caliph be able to enact his own decrees and reforms?
OTT_Enforce_Mecelle코0=Enforce the Mecelle
OTT_Enforce_Mecelle_desc코0=The civil code we have used since the Tanzimat era or the Mecelle code was first codified in 1877. Based on the Islamic Hanafi legal tradition, the code was the first enforcement of a unified law over all Ottoman citizens who previously according to the Millet system used their own codes. Throughout the years our goodwill has been misused by our minorities who have used it to escape Ottoman justice.
OTT_Revert_Social_Reforms코0=Revert Social Reforms
OTT_Revert_Social_Reforms_desc코0=The Kemalists and their allies have besmirched the good name of the Caliphate with their social reforms who are in clear contradiction to the Scriptures. Not only have they encouraged and actively supported an emancipation and unveilment movement, they have also attacked education, justice and other core tenets of our society. If we are to lay a new path, we will need to undo their foolish mistakes.
OTT_Desecularise_Army코0=Desecularise the Army
OTT_Desecularise_Army_desc코0=Infiltrated by Kemalist stooges and secularists, the armed forces of our Grand Caliphate have been besmirched by their bad moral reputation. Furthermore, they hang over our heads like a Sword of Damocles as they proved in 1909 when they brutally repressed our predecessors during a peaceful demonstration in the capital. They must be torn out if we are to create our new Ottoman state!
OTT_Caliphate_Of_Old코0=The Caliphate of Old
OTT_Caliphate_Of_Old_desc코0=When the Armies of Islam knocked on the gates of Vienna, none questioned the might of the Ottoman Empire and its Caliph. Now look at us! Suffering defeat after defeat, the empire has been dismantled by the follower of the Cross whilst abroad our muslim brethren are being coerced into cheap Western imitation and complacency, refusing to recognise their roots. Under our Caliph, we shall show them the true path!
OTT_Mosque_Renovation_Program코0=Refurbish Places of Worship
OTT_Mosque_Renovation_Program_desc코0=Home to the holiest places in all Islam, the Ottoman Empire has in the last few decades nonetheless often shirked its duty to maintain these places of worship and ensure their further development. Mosques in Diyarbakir, Damascus, Baghdad, Kostantiniyye and even in the Hejaz itself are showing clear signs of neglect. We will no longer stand for this rejection of our traditions!

### Foreign (Liberal)
OTT_Renovate_Sublime_Porte코0=Renovate the Sublime Porte
OTT_Renovate_Sublime_Porte_desc코0=Although used as a nickname for the central government of the Ottoman Empire, the Sublime Porte or Bab-ı Ali also refers to the entrance of the ministries across Topkapi. Sadly many of these buildings were badly harmed in a fire in 1911 and as such there was a relocation of many of its former inhabitants to the Dolmabahce. With restorations completed, the foreign ministry can finally return.
OTT_Join_Entente코0=Join the Entente
OTT_Join_Entente_desc코0=Despicable traitors to all Islam during the Weltkrieg, you will be hard-pressed to find a living soul willing to speak positively of the reactionary French slave state or their Anglo dogs, but, it cannot be denied that the geopolitical reality is leaving us with little choice. German might is crumbling and the clear industrial and military power of the United States may be all that's left to rebuke the Russian bear.
OTT_Join_Reichspakt코0=Join the Reichspakt
OTT_Join_Reichspakt_desc코0=Although relations with Berlin have cooled since the rise of the liberal coalition to power, we cannot deny that it is German military might that protects the Empire from the Russian bear, and despite concerns from pacifists, we have no choice but to recognise that if the Porte wishes to partake in the New World Order, we must stand united with the Germans in their time of need.
OTT_Join_Copro코0=Join the Co-prosperity Sphere
OTT_Join_Copro_desc코0=As the balance of power shifts from West to East and an alliance between American capital and Japanese spirit has been formed, the time has arrived for the Porte to also relinquish its ties to the old world. Standing strong with our Japanese friends and backed by the industrial might of the US of A, none will be able to oppose us!
OTT_Interventionism_Middle_East코0=Interventionism in the Middle East
OTT_Interventionism_Middle_East_desc코0=Carved up by British hawks and Arab warlords, our subjects on the Arab peninsula have long been drifting apart from us, and have established their own spheres of influence, running counter to our interests. As it befalls the Caliph of all Islam however, it is our duty to protect the safety of the Muslim people and free them from foreign, non-Turkish, meddling.
OTT_Support_Maghrebi_Rebels코0=Support Maghrebi Rebels
OTT_Support_Maghrebi_Rebels_desc코0=From Morocco to the former Ottoman regencies of Algiers, Tunis and Tripolitania, the Maghrebis are held dear in the heart of our government and suffering the hardest from the effects of colonialism. We shall work together to secure a free and strong Maghreb!
OTT_Reintegrate_MOJ코0=Reintegrate the M.O.J.
OTT_Reintegrate_MOJ_desc코0=Torn out of our grand empire by the despicable followers of Jesus Christ, the M.O.J. seems to have finally proven to the West what was already clear to us decades ago. Palestine is the homeland of Muslim Arabs and the arrival of Zionist thieves and other criminal scum has done nothing but destroy the stability and prosperity of our brethren!
OTT_Intervene_Arab_Unification_War코0=Intervene in the Arab War of Unification
OTT_Intervene_Arab_Unification_War_desc코0=The Houses of Rashid and Saud have been fighting a decades-long war over the ownership of Central Arabia, seeing multiple phases of open conflict interspersed with temporary armistices. Once more, the war has turned hot, and is threatening the safety of our Southern flank, and deputies from Iraq are demanding that the central government intervenes on their behalf.
OTT_Secure_Persian_Gulf코0=Secure the Persian Gulf
OTT_Secure_Persian_Gulf_desc코0=Crucial for the economy of Iraq and with the recent discovery of oil in the wider region, the Persian (or Arab) Gulf has risen to the forefront of Ottoman foreign policy as control over the region has been deemed of the utmost importance. The independent states surrounding it have been deemed liabilities as their questionable relations to the Porte are a serious threat to Ottoman monopoly over Middle Eastern oil.
OTT_Restore_Vilayet_of_Najd코0=Restore the Vilayet of Najd
OTT_Restore_Vilayet_of_Najd_desc코0=Our hold on the Arabian peninsula has always been a tenuous affair, as the state preferred demanding fealty from the local emirs, than exert direct control. Change was brought to this when Midhat Pasha retook al-Hasa and extended Ottoman control further inland, but pressed on all fronts, the Saudis were able to force us out in 1913. With the discovery of oil, the time has come to restore our rule over the Gulf. 
OTT_Incorporate_Muscat코0=Incorporate Muscat and Oman
OTT_Incorporate_Muscat_desc코0=Once a proud empire, the lands of the Sultans of Muscat have as one of the only in the Middle East never been subdued by the armies of the Caliph as friendly relations between the two powers rendered any prolonged military operations unnecessary. The once powerful fleet of Muscat has disappeared now however, and subject to Wahhabist raids, plagued by internal division and shouldering a paranoid and ineffective Sultan, it should be our duty to bring prosperity to Muscat.
OTT_Incorporate_Coastal_Emirates코0=Incorporate Coastal Emirates
OTT_Incorporate_Coastal_Emirates_desc코0=The various Sheikhdoms of the Arab Gulf prospered greatly under British protection, neglecting their duties to the Caliph and indirectly assisting in its demise. When British might disintegrated after their revolution, it was to Ottoman banners that they nonetheless flocked, hoping to preserve their thrones. Strategically important, the government in Southern Iraq has now outlined a plan to bring them closer to the Ottoman centre.
OTT_United_against_Imperialism코0=United against Imperialism
OTT_United_against_Imperialism_desc코0=As there was no unified front against the Imperialists, one by one the proud Muslim states fell to the claws of European colonialism. We as the predominant Muslim power in the world and the centre of the Sunni faith should see it as our duty to assist our brethren of the faith, protect them and show that the spirit of the Ummah has not yet been extinguished.
OTT_Stability_Arab_Peninsula코0=Stability on the Arab Peninsula
OTT_Stability_Arab_Peninsula_desc코0=For centuries, the inhospitable desert of Arabia has served as both a natural barrier and a path of invasion for its inhabitants. To defend the rich hinterlands of the Mashriq from said threat, we and those before us have worked with a string of allies and puppet states on the Southern flank and ensure the prosperity of Mesopotamia can't be harmed. The threat posed by the Wahhabists has shown that more than ever before, Ottoman control over Arabia is of the utmost importance.
OTT_Secure_Oil_Shipping코0=Secure Oil Shipping Routes
OTT_Secure_Oil_Shipping_desc코0=With oil exploitation in Iraq and Bahrain accelerating in the wake of the American collapse, the strait of Hormuz is slowly but surely developing itself into the most crucial access point to these seemingly unlimited reserves. Muscat is weak, divided by overly powerful nobles, religious differences and a decaying army. As such they need our guidance and as such serve as the shield that protects the Gulf from foreign interference.
OTT_Allies_in_the_Maghreb코0=Allies in the Maghreb
OTT_Allies_in_the_Maghreb_desc코0=Although lost almost a century ago, the various Muslim states of the Maghreb still look towards Kostantiniyye for guidance, paying their respects to the Caliph. Threatened by the Europeans in their endless drive for expansion, we should close the ranks and form a strong, united and most of all Muslim bloc.
OTT_Allies_in_the_Orient코0=Allies in the Orient
OTT_Allies_in_the_Orient_desc코0=For decades the Ottoman Empire has fostered relations with our distant brethren of the Orient. From the deserts and mountains of East Turkestan to the plains of Central Asia and the Indian lowlands, our brethren are ready to stand together in these troubling times.
OTT_Ottoman_Military_Missions코0=Ottoman Military Missions
OTT_Ottoman_Military_Missions_desc코0=The military reforms undertaken by our empire have led to awe from our neighbours, whose armies still rely on poorly-trained tribal militias. These nations have now requested experts from Kostantiniyye to aid them in their modernisation programmes, promising great compensation. The programme, which hopes to strengthen the Muslim bloc, serves also as an important political tool as sending Kemalist officers could strengthen domestic control over the army.
OTT_Association_Muslim_Nations코0=Found the Association of Muslim Nations
OTT_Association_Muslim_Nations_desc코0=Envisioned as a bloc of mutual prosperity, the Association of Muslim Nations would be an economic alliance with the goal of reducing the reliance on European and American goods whilst also boosting domestic industrialisation efforts of the various participating members. If we all bind together, we can't be picked off one by one and exert a certain pressure on the powers that be.
OTT_Council_Economic_Unity코0=Found the Council of Economic Unity
OTT_Council_Economic_Unity_desc코0=As outlined in Chapter 1 of the Economic Unity Agreement, the goals of the council are as follows: "Organise and consolidate economic relations among the States of the Arab League on bases that are consistent with the natural and historical links among them; and to provide the best conditions for flourishing their economies, developing their resources and ensuring the prosperity of their countries."
OTT_Railway_Connection코0=Interlink the Railroads
OTT_Railway_Connection_desc코0=With the modern age being pushed by cars and railroads, the need for an interconnected railway system has become more than apparent. Due to the difference in colonial occupants, each with their own railway gauge, we will have our work cut out for us, but plans for the unification of rail in Egypt, the Mashriq and Western Persia have already been drafted.
OTT_Joint_Military_Planning코0=Joint Military Exercises
OTT_Joint_Military_Planning_desc코0=Built according to the Ottoman model, our allies and military partners could do with some more guidance from the Sublime Porte. To improve international cooperation and furthermore paint a strong, united picture out of the Istanbul Pact, large scale exercises in the Mediterranean and Northern Syria have already been planned.
OTT_Reorganisation_Commision코0=Reorganise the Realm
OTT_Reorganisation_Commision_desc코0=Our vigorous desire to reform and adapt has left huge scars on the administrative structure of the realm, as positions, mandates and offices were often not granted to the most deserving or adept, but rather to those whose favour we needed the most. Now that the state has been sufficiently saved from foreign threats however, the time has come for a large-scale clean-up that will purge the empire of its corrupt underbelly.
OTT_Abolish_Vilayet_Yerevan코0=Abolish the Vilayet of Yerevan
OTT_Abolish_Vilayet_Yerevan_desc코0=When Armenia was conquered, trouble on the ground and continued guerrilla attacks made control over this far-flung province tricky. In an attempt to pacify the population and ensure that they couldn't pose a threat to our flank, a series of military governors were installed to maintain order. Now that the empire has taken a decisively different course however, Armenian autonomy groups have pushed for the introduction of provincial assemblies.
OTT_Integrate_Yemen코0=Reintegrate the Imamate
OTT_Integrate_Yemen_desc코0=Although a working relation with the Imamate was founded just before the Weltkrieg, it seems that the ambitions of Yahya were too great for this world and with his betrayal during the Levantine war, he has shown his true colours. Therefore it has become clear that the Imamate can no longer exist as a separate entity within the Ottoman Empire, and that it should be replaced by a series of provincial assemblies as to cater to its Sunni, Zaydi and Jewish population.
OTT_Integrate_Tripolitania코0=Reintegrate the Vilayet of Tripolitania
OTT_Integrate_Tripolitania_desc코0=Consisting of three distinct regions, the 'Regency of Tripolitania' has been at the side of the Sultan ever since 1551. Despite its age, the government in Kostantiniyye didn't interfere much in its local affairs as its poverty made it too expensive to embark on costly military campaigns to quell the local tribes. With the importance of the Western flank rising and the threat posed by the remaining Senussi real, the time has come to reign Libya back in.
OTT_Statutes_of_Autonomy코0=Proclaim the Statutes of Autonomy
OTT_Statutes_of_Autonomy_desc코0=Although the Federation model which the Ottoman Empire recently adopted has been seen as a massive step forwards for various autonomy and separatist movements, the expansion of Ottoman control towards Egypt, Iran and the Arab peninsula has made policy makers in Kostantiniyye move towards an even more drastic version of decentralisation, wherein provinces can choose to exert even greater control over their internal affairs.
OTT_Reorganise_Kurdistan코0=Reorganise the Kurdish Vilayets
OTT_Reorganise_Kurdistan_desc코0=Stretching from Anatolia to Iran, the various Kurdish fiefdoms of old have now finally all been integrated within the same state, after centuries of division between Persian and Ottoman suzerains. The huge divide between the Kurdish tribes, in language, culture and religion, has made it difficult to foster a strong nationalist entity, something our government now hopes to exploit to instil a sense of Ottomanism.
OTT_Reorganise_Azerbaijan코0=Reorganise the Azeri Vilayets
OTT_Reorganise_Azerbaijan_desc코0=Although Shi'ite compared to our Sunni population, the links between the Turkic peoples of Azerbaijan and Anatolia have always been strong, as a similar language and culture made the exchanging of ideas and goods swift and easy. Finally ripped out of the influence sphere of both Teheran and Berlin, the time has come to reunite the Turkic people and bind them together in a stronger and unbreakable bond.
OTT_Reorganise_Khuzestan코0=Integrate the Emirate of Arabistan
OTT_Reorganise_Khuzestan_desc코0=Founded in the 15th century, the Emirate of Arabistan has survived as an independent entity in the South-West of Iran clutched in-between the Ottomans and the Persians. Although the treaty of Erzurum in 1847 gave Persia the sole authority over the Emirate, the recent war with Persia has led to the acquisition of the oil rich province. With much of its governance done through the absolute rule of the Emir, much work will be required to make them fit the 20th century.
OTT_Reorganise_Egypt코0=Reorganise the Egyptian Vilayets
OTT_Reorganise_Egypt_desc코0=The disaster that befell the Ottoman state in the 19th century, and which was only aggravated at the turn of the 20th century, has now been corrected as [OTT_ConstantinopleFallback] and Cairo are now finally reunited! To prevent this from happening again however, the government has decreed an extensive reorganisation of both parts of the Empire including economic, administrative and cultural adjustments.
OTT_Reorganise_Sudan코0=Settle the Sudanese Affair
OTT_Reorganise_Sudan_desc코0=Although Sudan was never a core part of the Ottoman Empire, only being conquered in 1820 under the Ottoman vassal Mohammad Ali, it has now nonetheless found itself within our empire as its ancient connections to Egypt (strengthened under the Khedivate and later Sultanate) led to its incorporation after the Levantine War. Much work is to be done however before 'Turkiyya' will truly become an Ottoman province.
OTT_First_Elections_of_the_Grand_Assembly코0=First Elections of the Grand Assembly
OTT_First_Elections_of_the_Grand_Assembly_desc코0=As territorial expansion has brought a wide variety of peoples into our empire, the time has come to confer to them the rights of all Ottoman citizens, including the right to send representatives to the Meclis-i Mebusân (Chamber of Deputies). As the size of this body has seen exponential growth due to the vast lands we recently acquired, the body has seen its name changed to 'Büyük Meclisi' or 'Grand Assembly'.

### Economic (Liberal)
OTT_Raise_Import_Tariffs_lib코0=Raise Import Tariffs
OTT_Raise_Import_Tariffs_lib_desc코0=To encourage domestic industry and prevent reliance on foreign construction materials and basic consumer goods, the government will raise import tariffs substantially. Although this is a great boon for the nascent Anatolian industry, many in Beirut, Alexandretta and Haifa fear that this will greatly damage their status as gateways to the Orient.
OTT_Restrict_Foreign_Exchange_Regime_lib코0=Restrict Foreign Exchange Regime
OTT_Restrict_Foreign_Exchange_Regime_lib_desc코0=Lack of confidence in the Ottoman government has pushed many investors to sell off their Liras in favour of foreign currencies in recent months, to the detriment of its value. By restricting our domestic investors' capacity to sell off their Lira's we can strengthen our currency compared to the leading currencies of the world like the Mark.
OTT_Quantity_Restrictions_Import_lib코0=Impose Quantity Restrictions on Import
OTT_Quantity_Restrictions_Import_lib_desc코0=Whilst the government aims to create a strong local industry, it too often finds itself relying on goods imported from the Donau-monarchy or the German Empire. Steel, machinery, chemicals, etc. are all imported which makes us not only reliant on those nations, but greatly hampers domestic goods as they can't compete with the cheap export products of the larger manufactures abroad.
OTT_Ziraat_Bankasi_Credit_lib코0=Ziraat Bankasi Credit Program
OTT_Ziraat_Bankasi_Credit_lib_desc코0=Originally the brainchild of Midhat Pasha, the Memleket Sandığı was reorganised into the Ziraat Bankasi in 1888. Providing stability and relief for farmers, still the majority of our population, the bank has been greatly expanded over the years. As prices for agricultural goods are in flux, following the collapse of Ukrainian and German markets, the vast reserves of the bank will be used to fight the crisis.
OTT_Toprak_Mahsulleri_Ofisi_lib코0=Open the Toprak Mahsulleri Ofisi
OTT_Toprak_Mahsulleri_Ofisi_lib_desc코0=According to Law No 3491, this agency will prevent abnormal decrease or increase of the wheat prices against producers and consumers, will protect and regulate the wheat industry, will import or export wheat when necessary, will monitor wheat production trends and market movements in the world, will establish milling facilities and bakeries in locations to be determined and will carry on other similar tasks.
OTT_Balance_the_Budget_lib코0=Balance the Budget
OTT_Balance_the_Budget_lib_desc코0=When the Ottoman Empire collapsed under the strain of the debts it had racked up during the Crimean War, an international organisation called the OPDA (Ottoman Public Debt Administration) essentially took over our economy. The disgrace and damage it has caused remain a vibrant memory in the minds of many Turkish economists who since have sworn to maintain a balanced budget at all cost.
OTT_Liberalising_National_Economy코0=Liberalise the National Economy
OTT_Liberalising_National_Economy_desc코0=The National Economy model as followed by the OHF has damaged our economy beyond repair, and instead of the promised exponential economic growth, has only served to destroy the prosperity of non-Muslim subjects for the benefit of the ruling class. No more! We will tear down this racist system and in its stead, build a new and prosperous Ottoman economy.
OTT_Imperial_Institute_Technology코0=The Imperial Institute for Technology
OTT_Imperial_Institute_Technology_desc코0=Although the Ottoman Empire boasts a fair selection of institutes for higher learning, there is a severe lack of technical expertise in the realm, which has severely complicated the industrialisation of the empire. To solve this, the government has proposed to open the Imperial Institute for Technology in Kostantiniyye, in close cooperation with academics from Austria and Germany.
OTT_Repeal_National_Protection_Law코0=Repeal the National Protection Law
OTT_Repeal_National_Protection_Law_desc코0=Enacted by the Kemalist government to protect the nascent Turkish industry, the national protection law put severe limits on Turkish imports, banning all imports for goods such as processed food, alcohol, shoes, leather goods and other consumer goods. Furthermore the imports of even materials such as cement received restriction which according to the DF greatly stifled the private sector.
OTT_Enable_Foreign_Investment코0=Enable Foreign Investment
OTT_Enable_Foreign_Investment_desc코0=Although foreign investment was never blocked by the Kemalist government, who pursued a policy of cooperation between the private and public sector, funded largely by foreign credit, they did make it harder for Ottoman enterprises themselves to solicit foreign funding without going through a state institution. That this has stifled growth is universally agreed on by the liberals and will no longer do!
OTT_Foreign_Capital_Incentives_Law코0=The Foreign Capital Incentives Law
OTT_Foreign_Capital_Incentives_Law_desc코0=Enacted at the request of the DF, the Law on Encouragement of Foreign Capital is meant to reinvigorate the Ottoman economy and make it more accessible for foreign investors through principles such as “free transfer” and “national treatment”. Heavy resistance to the bill was uttered by the OHF however who see this as the destruction of the National Economy model.
OTT_Mesopotamian_Oil_Exploration코0=Mesopotamian Oil Exploration
OTT_Mesopotamian_Oil_Exploration_desc코0=Although most operations of the TPC and its German-Dutch allies are centred around Kirkuk and Mosul in the North of Iraq, large untapped reserves have recently been discovered in the South of Iraq, near the important harbours of Basra and Kuwait. Since these are also already tightly connected to the Iraqi rail network, TPC has requested a concession from the Porte to expand operations throughout Iraq.
OTT_Import_Agricultural_Equipment코0=Import Agricultural Equipment
OTT_Import_Agricultural_Equipment_desc코0=Although the Ottoman Empire, unlike Egypt, is not yet capped by the size of its agricultural lands, there has nonetheless been a great drive to improve the efficiency of the large estates dotted around the country, through the use of modern equipment. Where the Kemalists primarily intended to set up domestic production of these tools, the liberals have shown a desire to skip this step and import directly from Europe.
OTT_Berlin_Baghdad_Exploitation_Rights코0=Berlin-Baghdad Exploitation Rights
OTT_Berlin_Baghdad_Exploitation_Rights_desc코0=When the original deal for the Berlin-Baghdad railroad was signed with German investors, they were given extensive land grants on either side of the tracks to fully develop and exploit. This arrangement changed near the end of the war however as large investors such as Deutsche Bank pulled out of the project, fearing an imminent collapse of the Ottoman state. Lacking domestic funds, we should bring this deal back.
OTT_Opel_Tophane_Factory코0=Opel Tophane Factory
OTT_Opel_Tophane_Factory_desc코0=Long discussed with Opel, the idea of a German automotive company establishing a production facility in the Ottoman Empire to cater to the rapidly growing demand for cars in the Middle East is not new. Disagreements about the financing and the nationality of its workers constantly postponed the idea. It was never buried however and our liberal government seems more than willing to reopen negotiations.
OTT_Turkish_Industrial_Development_Bank코0=The Turkish Industrial Development Bank
OTT_Turkish_Industrial_Development_Bank_desc코0=Aimed at promoting private initiative and providing loans to industrial entrepreneurs, the Turkish Industrial Development Bank is a government initiative that has been set up after long and difficult negotiations with the ruling coalition. Whilst its primary function for now is to mediate between European exporters and Ottoman importers, it plans to later on establish industries of its own.
OTT_Anatolian_Road_Program코0=Anatolian Roads Program
OTT_Anatolian_Road_Program_desc코0=As the primary focus of the Ottoman economy for most of its history has been on Rumelia, Asia Minor and Syria, the interior of Anatolia is severely lacking the infrastructure expected of a modern nation. Farmers are more often than not disconnected from their villages or cities, causing massive issues for our supply chains and inhibiting the potential of integrating these people in the world economy.
OTT_Privatise_Land_Ownership코0=Privatise Land Ownership
OTT_Privatise_Land_Ownership_desc코0=The idea of private land ownership is not a new one, but remains as of today a contentious topic in the Ottoman Empire as the promising Land Reform Act, part of the Tanzimat reforms, caused massive social upheaval in the Mashriq, leading to the enforced serfdom of large parts of the Iraqi population and opposition of the conservative bloc who saw in this nothing but a shoddy attempt at European imitation.
OTT_Populist_Economics코0=Populist Economics
OTT_Populist_Economics_desc코0=To their regret, the cabinet has been forced to recognise that the Ottoman people after all weren't ready yet for the full brunt of the capitalist system, and that the long awaited surge in private initiative has proven to be a dud. To remedy this and to cater to the growing unhappiness with the government, they have decided to intervene more heavily in the economy pursuing a populist direction.
OTT_Turkish_Cement_Factory코0=Expand the Turkish Cement Factories
OTT_Turkish_Cement_Factory_desc코0=A key requirement for the rapid expansion of both industry and real estate, cement factories were the first successful focus of the Ottoman industrialisation plans in the 1920s. Despite this success however, the demand for cement and other building materials keeps climbing and to cater to these needs, the construction of several new factories in Asia Minor has been ordered.
OTT_Sugar_Industry코0=Expand the Sugar Industry
OTT_Sugar_Industry_desc코0=Although sugar beets can be found all across Turkey, it is the regions around Ankara, Konya, Eskisehir, Afyon, Tokat and Yozgat that really power production. As part of the government’s initiative to increase the production of processed food products, large sugar factories have been set up to process the sugar beets and deliver the finished products to the world market.
OTT_Textile_Industry코0=Expand the Textile Industry
OTT_Textile_Industry_desc코0=An important export product of the Ottoman Empire for centuries, the textile industry encountered a large scale decline in the 19th century, as competition with the industrial weaveries of Manchester collapsed the demand for artisanal textiles. The tradition nonetheless still stands and with the collapse of the Western industries to syndicalism, the rise of the Syrian weaveries has taken the world by storm.
OTT_Mechanised_Agriculture코0=Mechanised Agriculture
OTT_Mechanised_Agriculture_desc코0=Whilst the ox and the camel have long been trusted partners of the Ottoman farmer, it has become apparent that they can no longer compete with the smoke-billowing beasts of the industrial era. Therefore, in cooperation with loosened restrictions on agricultural imports, the liberal government has fully pulled the card of the small landowners and set up structures to assist them in acquiring material.
OTT_Election_Factories코0=The 'Election Factories'
OTT_Election_Factories_desc코0=Ridiculed by the opposition as "Election Factories", the new liberal government has realised that solely reliance on the free market will not industrialise the Ottoman Empire and has now attempted to outdo the OHF national economy plans by fully committing itself to the rapid expansion of the industry, without any desire to keep a balanced budget. Will this save or destroy the Ottoman state...?

### Starting
ott_institutionalised_islam코0=Institutionalised Islam
ott_institutionalised_islam_desc코0=Religion has always played an important role in the Ottoman Empire, to no small degree because our Padishah is the Caliph of all Islam. Nonetheless it would take until Abdulhamid II until one could really speak of an organised state religion wherein Kostantiniyye arranged everything from protection of the Holy Sites to education of the Ulema. Striving for a policy of Pan-Islamism, the faith was seen as the metaphorical glue holding the empire together under the Sultan-Caliph himself.\n\nThis control however has come at a cost as by bringing Islam closer to the chest, it as well now influences state policy at a higher level with various large Sufi orders possessing incredible political capital and opposing many of the attempted secularist reforms.

ott_widespread_illiteracy코0=Widespread Illiteracy
ott_widespread_illiteracy_desc코0=Illiteracy is widespread amongst the common people of the empire, as both the difficulty of the Perso-Arabic script and a general disinterest of the lower classes to even bother learning to read is greatly hampering the industrialisation of our grand empire.

ott_armed_neutrality_desc코0=The brave men who fought against imperialism during the Weltkrieg lay scattered around the Empire in military mass graves, and total casualties of the war encompass over 25% of our pre-war population.

ott_military_loyalty코0=Kemalist Officer Corps
ott_military_loyalty_desc코0=Built on the Prussian Ethos imposed by the German Military Mission just before the Weltkrieg, the military is the de facto power in the Ottoman Empire.

ott_universal_suffrage코0=Emancipation Vanguard
ott_universal_suffrage_desc코0=The Ottoman Empire is a shining beacon of Emancipation, as almost nowhere else in the world do women experience the same amount of political freedom.

ott_varlik_vargisi코0=Varlık Vergisi
ott_varlik_vargisi_desc코0=What can be seen as a successor to the Jizya tax on non-Muslim subjects in the Ottoman Empire, the application of this 'war' tax is leading to significant political issues as its very discriminatory application is in open conflict with the constitution. Nonetheless the revenue it brings in is significant and in a time like this we don't have much choice.

ott_pluralist_constitution코0=Pluralist Constitution
ott_pluralist_constitution_desc코0=After much political debate between different reformist groups, a new Ottoman Constitution has been written to supersede that of 1876. Thanks to the efforts of more liberally-minded politicians, this new charter is based on pluralist principles, providing citizens with significant political and social freedoms, and shifting the balance of power from the Sultan to elected officials.

ott_authoritarian_constitution코0=Authoritarian Constitution
ott_authoritarian_constitution_desc코0=After much political debate between different reformist groups, a new Ottoman Constitution has been written to supersede that of 1876.

The power of the Sultan has been firmly entrenched, giving him the power over the empire’s politics and religions.

ott_renaissance코0=The Ottoman Renaissance
ott_renaissance_desc코0=The Europeans deemed us weak and sickly, the Iranian believed we wouldn't risk confronting them, and the Arabs believed they were an equal match for the power of Turkish boots.

ott_bloated_administration코0=Bloated Bureaucracy
ott_bloated_administration_desc코0=The system of vilayets which has been defining Ottoman Empire for decades now has unfortunately been allowed to fester for quite some time now, and as a result the entire structure has become unwieldy and inefficient.

ott_miri_land_distribution_desc코0=The Miri lands, which are those effectively under the control of the state, are being sold off across the Ottoman Empire.

ott_widespread_illiteracy_liberal_desc코0=In spite of some government efforts, the Ottoman Empire is plagued by widespread illiteracy, which severely limits the empires ability to innovate and adopt new traditions. Significant efforts will need to be made in order to overcome these challenges.

ott_mosque_cost코0=Renovation and Restoration Program
ott_mosque_cost_desc코0=In line with the Islamist line of the Arslan government, the Ottoman State has embarked on a programme of mosque renovations as well as improving other places of worship.

ott_military_purge코0=Military Purge
ott_military_purge_desc코0=In order to remove potential opposition to the new regime, the government has begun the dismissal and early retirement of many officers deemed to be too secular.

### Egypt related
ott_military_restrictions코0=Military Restrictions

ott_absorbed_state_monopolies_desc코0=Thanks to the new influence they now wield over the Khedivate, the Ottoman government has seized control of assets which once belonged to the Egyptian state, effectively giving them an effective monopoly over many sectors of their client state's economy. While this has brought more money back to Kostantiniyye, it will serve as a reminder to many Egyptians of their humiliation.

ott_egy_integration코0=Egyptian Integration Effort
ott_egy_integration_desc코0=Deeming any independence to Egypt to be a risk not worth taking, the Ottoman government has begun the process of reintegrating the region back into the Empire as a whole. This process will not be easy however, and there are many who vocally protest this move.

ott_egy_economic_upheaval코0=Economic Turmoil
ott_egy_economic_upheaval_desc코0=With the attempts to integrate Egypt underway, the previously separate Egyptian and Ottoman economies now must find some way to co-exist.

ott_statutes_of_autonomy코0=Statutes of Autonomy
ott_statutes_of_autonomy_desc코0=Believing decentralisation to be the key in maintaining the empire, the government has put forward a series of Statutes of Autonomy for the various people groups of the Empire.
