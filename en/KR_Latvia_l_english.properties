KRLAT.1.t코0=Bittersweet Victory
KRLAT.1.d코0=For seven hundred years Latvia was subjugated - lorded over by Germans, Poles, Swedes, and Russians one after the other. Many Latvians, however, never lost hope. They knew that freedom would one day come. The Latvian National Awakening of the 19th century enkindled similar dreams throughout the entire populace. The Young Latvians and the New Current movement in particular led to the development of modern Latvian nationalism and politics.\n\nAt the end of the Weltkrieg, these Latvian patriots at last had the chance to fight for freedom, and yet, this struggle was in vain. Divided between exiled movements in Riga, Petrograd and Moscow, the Latvians never made a true declaration of independence like their Estonian brothers had - the socialist Iskolat in Valmiera was destroyed by German arms, the Latvian National Council in Petrograd never returned, and the Riga Democratic Bloc surrendered to the new Baltic German order. Latvian nationalism did not die out, however, and returned even stronger, embraced by socialist exiles in the Union of Britain and the large Latvian community in Russia. The collapse of the United Baltic Duchy has fulfilled the dream of so many at long last - Latvia is finally an independent state.\n\nThe capital of the Latvian people, Riga, however, fell just out of the grasp of the Forest Brothers, and a German redoubt remains in control of the city, preparing for an opportunity to snuff out Latvia's independence. This insult to the pride of our nation must never be forgotten - and one way or another, the jewel of the Baltic Sea will return to its rightful owners. As the world inches closer to war, Latvia is sure to play a role.
KRLAT.1.a코0=Latvians, never forget Riga!

KRLAT.2.t코0=Dual Rule in Latvia
KRLAT.2.d코0=While Estonian nationalists generally supported a unified provisional government in the aftermath of the collapse of the Russia Empire, Latvian partisans remained internally divided until the bitter end. A similar, though less dysfunctional dynamic has emerged once again.\n\nIn the east, Jānis Kurelis heads a faction of trained exiles from Russia and the so-called "Imanta Regiment". Inspired by the ideas of his mentor, Kārlis Ulmanis, Kurelis envisions a uniquely Latvian political system, strong enough to weather the battles yet to come.\n\nIn the west, centred around Liepāja, lies the so-called "Second Iskolat", organised by the Revolutionary Latvian Legion and led by Jēkabs Peterss. They descend from the Latvian Bolsheviks who escaped the failing October Revolution to join their peers in the West, and have returned home to turn Latvia into a model Marxist-Leninist state.\n\nTo ease the brewing conflict between these two factions, a Constitutional Convention has been called in Valmiera to decide the nature of the new state - without the backing of either one of the main players, however, it is effectively powerless.
KRLAT.2.a코0=There can only be one regime in Latvia.

KRLAT.3.t코0=Manteuffel's Insurgency
KRLAT.3.d코0=The collapse of the United Baltic Duchy was not as definitive as it first appeared, and low-level fighting continues between Latvian and isolated German units. The Second Baltic German Battalion of the Baltische Landeswehr, commanded by Hans von Manteuffel-Szoege, has proven a particularly tough nut to crack. Now known as the \"Eiserne Division\", they have torn a path of blood and fire through the Latvian countryside with the ultimate goal of restoring the Duchy.\n\nTheir supplies and ammunition are running low, however, and the Germans of Riga have been thusfar unable to provide them much assistance - as such, with few options left, Manteuffel has ordered an all-or-nothing attack on Valmiera, the seat of the Constitutional Convention and the headquarters of Kurelis's clique. Despite attrition and their partial degeneration into a horde of looting brigands, the Eiserne Division remains a powerful force, and is equally matched with its opponents in the Valmiera region.\n\nKurelis and his assembled men could potentially withstand this final German assault by themselves, but perhaps they should put politics aside for a moment, request aid from the Iskolat, and stand together with the Jēkabs Peterss and the Revolutionary Latvian Legion?
KRLAT.3.a코0=We will do this ourselves,\nthe socialists are not to be trusted.
KRLAT.3.b코0=It’s too dangerous, we must\nreach out to Peterss and the reds.

KRLAT.4.t코0=Kurelis's Latvia
KRLAT.4.d코0=Kurelis has managed to crush the last remnants of the Eiserne Division alone, and his position as the hero of the people has become even more eminent.\nIn his actions, he has seized upon his initial momentum and general enthusiasm among the wider populace. The Constitutional Convention in Valmiera has become a forgone conclusion, with support for Kurelis far outweighing that for Peterss, and indeed, several prominent members of the Revolutionary Latvian Legion are thinking twice about their leadership.\n Had Peterss been a in a stronger position, more resistance would likely have been expected. But for now, the dreams of a Second Iskolat Republic are sidelined, as it is Kurelis’ vision that will lead Latvia forward!
KRLAT.4.a코0=Latvia for Latvians!

KRLAT.5.t코0=Peterss's Latvia
KRLAT.5.d코0=This morning Kurelis was discovered hiding in Liepāja by socialist militiamen. Comrade Peterss and his men managed to overcome Kurelis's contingent, capturing Kurelis himself. A socialist Republic, known as the "Iskolat" was quickly declared, though some regions have been slow to recognise the change.
KRLAT.5.a코0=Now we build real socialism!

KRLAT.6.t코0=Latvia wishes to join the Third Internationale
KRLAT.6.d코0=We have received a diplomatic message from our comrades in Eastern Europe - Latvia, also known as the Iskolat Republic, wishes to finally put an end to their enforced neutrality and join the Third Internationale as an equal partner. Should we accept the Latvian Leninists into the worldwide Syndicalist community?
KRLAT.6.a코0=Of course!
KRLAT.6.b코0=We'd rather not.

KRLAT.7.t코0=We are accepted
KRLAT.7.d코0=The Internationale has accepted our fledgling republic into their alliance.
KRLAT.7.a코0=Hurrah!

KRLAT.8.t코0=We have been denied
KRLAT.8.d코0=The Internationale has refused to accept our fledgling republic into their alliance.
KRLAT.8.a코0=Damn.

KRLAT.9.t코0=The Wind Blows
KRLAT.9.d코0=When the Second Weltkrieg began, the loss of Latvia and Estonia strangely provided protection to Riga. The two states, Latvia and Estonia, served as a neutral bulwark which protected Riga from the full force of the Russian invasion. The Riga defence forces and their commanders, however, understood the fleeting nature of this state of affairs. Patrols became more frequent, logistics systems were strengthened, and a system of food rationing was implemented for general population.\n\nIncreasing Latvian military movement near the city, sometimes even in the range of Rigan artillery outposts seemed to prove the validity of the Rigan Defence Force's fears - although the German troops opted to not fire upon the Latvians just yet. Enemy artillery is stationed in the surroundings of the city, preparing to bombard hastily assembled barricades and fortifications. The Latvians remain silent in diplomatic channels, as if they have forgotten that Riga exists entirely.\n\nBoth sides had something to finish from their last engagements in 1936. The Latvians - to evict the Germans from their homeland at last, to reclaim Riga, their one and only capital. The Baltic Germans - to destroy this insurgency for good, and reclaim their birthright.\n\nA chilling wind blows across the streets of Riga, and with it, follows a barrage of yells, all shouting the same thing.
KRLAT.9.a코0=To the barricades!

KRLAT.10.t코0=The Assembly Convenes
KRLAT.10.d코0=An extraordinary session of the Constitutional Assembly has been called in Liepāja with the aim of rewriting the provisional Latvian constitution in the face of increased political dominance by Kurelis and his clique. The Assembly cannot help but cede a large degree of power to Kurelis and the executive, a stark contrast from the political structure laid out provisionally, but many questions remain unresolved.
KRLAT.10.a코0=We have a lot to sort out.

KRLAT.11.t코0=The Question of Powers of the Seima
KRLAT.11.d코0=While the Seima shall have the nominal authority to enact legislation independent of the executive, members of Kurelis's faction hold differing views on the degree of direct oversight the office should have over legislative action.
KRLAT.11.a코0=Don't water down the legislature
KRLAT.11.b코0=The President shall have unrestricted veto powers

KRLAT.12.t코0=Meeting place of the Seima
KRLAT.12.d코0=The Latvian constitution in exile held that the Latvian assembly should convene in Riga and only in Riga. However, it did not consider the special circumstances the country now faces. The question remains: should we formally establish the assembly in Liepāja or continue to only operate from the city de-facto awaiting the liberation of Riga.
KRLAT.12.a코0=Riga is our capital.
KRLAT.12.b코0=Recognise the reality of the situation - Liepāja.

KRLAT.13.t코0=The Generalis
KRLAT.13.d코0=The extraordinary challenges facing Latvia at the moment have won wide popular support for Kurelis's authoritative actions. While Kurelis shall remain president at least until the end of the current crisis, some have called for his rule to be plainly written into the constitution - president-for-life.
KRLAT.13.a코0=Write it into the document.
KRLAT.13.b코0=He shall remain only until the crisis passes.

KRLAT.14.t코0=Foreign Policy
KRLAT.14.d코0=Latvia is in a difficult position on the global stage. Indeed the country is under diplomatic pressure from both Germany and Russia, and the threat of invasion from either of those powers looms large. The provisional constitution gave the Seima a role in treaty-making and diplomatic appointments, with the assent of the body required for treaties to be ratified and posts to be filled. While awkward, and given Kurelis's control over the Seima, a bit of a farce, some call for this quirk of the constitution to be kept intact.
KRLAT.14.a코0=The Seima must approve the government's decisions
KRLAT.14.b코0=Only the Generalis knows what is good

KRLAT.15.t코0=Responsibilities of Powers
KRLAT.15.d코0=The last major debate of the Constituent Assembly concerns whether or not the president can unilaterally dissolve the legislature in perpetuity. While doing so would be highly inefficient and place and outsized burden on the administration, allowing for such under the right circumstances would all but eliminate the independence of the legislature at least for the remainder of the crisis.
KRLAT.15.a코0=The Executive has no Power over the Seima.
KRLAT.15.b코0=The president may dissolve the Seima.

KRLAT.16.t코0=A Strong Executive
KRLAT.16.d코0=The directorial system has been all but eliminated, with the office of the president assuming greater authority. General Kurelis, while nominally neither head of the government nor the state, now directs most functions of the central government.
KRLAT.16.a코0=A hero at the helm.

KRLAT.17.t코0=Executive Authority Constrained
KRLAT.17.d코0=The directorial system established after the collapse of the United Baltic Duchy has been entrenched while the authority and role of the state has grown.
KRLAT.17.a코0=Onwards!

KRLAT.18.t코0=Integration of Dvinsk
KRLAT.18.d코0=The administration of Dvinsk has become increasingly ordinary. Owing to the area's strong Latvian identity, it has quickly been integrated into our administration.
KRLAT.18.a코0=Latvia is whole!

KRLAT.19.t코0=Economic Stabilisation
KRLAT.19.d코0=The economic crisis which followed the dissolution of the United Baltic Duchy has finally subsided.\n\nWe are now in a position where our economy is functioning smoothly, as the measures we have undertaken after independence have come to fruition.
KRLAT.19.a코0=Great!

KRLAT.20.t코0=Political Stabilisation
KRLAT.20.d코0=The political crisis which followed the dissolution of the United Baltic Duchy has finally subsided.\n\nThe independent Latvian administration has become thoroughly entrenched.
KRLAT.20.a코0=Great!

KRLAT.21.t코0=Kurelis's Latvia
KRLAT.21.d코0=Kurelis has convinced the members of the Constitutional Convention that Peterss’ goal in forming a socialist state will result in nothing more than an immediate loss of our independence. The socialists’ attempts to work with the workers in the city of Riga will only mean greater German influence in our country, invariably leading to German re-annexation.\nIn this attack on Peterss and his movement, Kurelis has seized upon his previous momentum and general enthusiasm among the wider populace. The Constitutional Convention in Valmiera has swayed in his favour, with support for Kurelis now outweighing that for Peterss.\nHad Peterss been a in a stronger position, more resistance would likely have been expected. But for now, the dreams of a Second Iskolat Republic are sidelined, as it is Kurelis’ vision that will lead Latvia forward!
KRLAT.21.a코0=Latvia for Latvians!

KRLAT.22.t코0=Kurelis's Latvia
KRLAT.22.d코0=Kurelis has convinced enough members of the Constitutional Convention that Peterss’ is unfit to lead to lead the country. Such is his cowardice, that the socialist leader cannot even bring himself to defend his own position in the Convention. If this is the case, how could we expect such a man to ensure Latvia’s independence, let alone retake our capital? \nIn this attack on Peterss and his movement, Kurelis has seized upon his previous momentum and general enthusiasm among the wider populace. The Constitutional Convention in Valmiera has swayed in his favour, with support for Kurelis now outweighing that for Peterss.\nHad Peterss been a in a stronger position, more resistance would likely have been expected. But for now, the dreams of a Second Iskolat Republic are sidelined, as it is Kurelis’ vision that will lead Latvia forward!
KRLAT.22.a코0=Latvia for Latvians!

ISKO.1.t코0=The Convention Convenes
ISKO.1.d코0=The Eiserne Division were poised to launch one last desperate attempt to take Valmiera, and with it, the Constitutional Convention. Seeing Latvia’s newly-gained independence to be too fragile to risk losing to inter-partisan squabbling, Kurelis took it upon himself to call upon his political rivals for aid.\nJust as Manteuffel’s men were set to assail Kurelis’ position, Peterss and his Revolutionary Latvian Legion ambushed them, and with support coming from Valmiera, the final remnant of the German forces were made short work of.\nWith the independence of Latvia secured, even if without Riga, the Constitutional Convention must now decide on Latvia’s future direction. As with many post-independence states however, the next challenge may be to navigate the differences in our population’s views, without descending into civil war and chaos. \nBoth Kurelis and Peterss are seen as viable candidates for leadership – both seek continued Latvian independence, and both seek to regain the City of Riga. Peterss believes that only with the alliance of the Commune of France can Latvia remain independent. Kurelis, on the other hand, is adamant that Latvia must put itself first – either by remaining truly independent, or, depending on how the situation develops, by seeing common cause with another likeminded regional power bloc that may wish to challenge the Germans.\nAs the stability and very existence of an independent Latvia is at stake, Kurelis has decided that it is in the country’s interest to end this farce of a Constitutional Convention as soon as possible. Lest Latvia be handed over to socialists, who run the risk of losing the previous independence we have finally gained after centuries, we must make sure to discredit Peterss and his movement. Or, we could just arrest him... 
ISKO.1.a코0=We will accuse Peterss of fraternising with the enemy!
ISKO.1.b코0=We will quietly arrest Peterss under false pretences!

ISKO.2.t코0=The Capture Fails
ISKO.2.d코0=When the small group of men from the Imanta Regiment came to Liepāja to secretly apprehend Peterss, he was nowhere to be found. They were soon made aware that Peterss has been leading his movement from the underground for the past number of days, and details of his precise whereabouts at the moment are scanty at best.\nSupport from the public and the Constitutional Convention itself remains within reach for both main groups, so we cannot take any chances. It may be best to root out Peterss like the rat he is, and apprehend him definitely, rather than resort to the more subtle means we had tried and failed with previously. Or, we just could make an example of his cowardice, increasing our own support among the Convention.\nOf course, our attempts to publically root him out may not go down as well with the general population, but they will learn the necessity of such measures, in time.
ISKO.2.a코0=We will not leave Liepāja until we find him!
ISKO.2.b코0=Show the people that Peterss’ weakness makes him unfit to rule!

ISKO.3.t코0=A Fork in the Road
ISKO.3.d코0=Revolutionary syndicalism has come to dominate the international socialist movement. In Latvia, however, many socialists, including much of the leadership of our new republic, still cling to the ideals of the Bolsheviks. While the relationship would not be otherwise unworkable, agreeing to adopt syndicalist ideas, at least in part, could facilitate greater cooperation with the syndicalist powers of Europe. Should this idea be made a reality?
ISKO.3.a코0=Hold fast to the ideals of the Bolsheviks
ISKO.3.b코0=Implement a Syndicalist model

ISKO.4.t코0=Looking to the Past
ISKO.4.d코0=Syndicalism has been rejected in favour of the further development of the ideals of the old Bolsheviks of the Russian revolution to whom we are so intimately linked.
ISKO.4.a코0=Lenin shall be avenged.

ISKO.5.t코0=Syndicalism Ascendant
ISKO.5.d코0=The ascendency of syndicalism cannot be denied. To facilitate relations with the powers of the Third Internationale, we must accept a basically syndicalist economic model.
ISKO.5.a코0=A necessary choice.

ISKO.6.t코0=The Direction of the Economy
ISKO.6.d코0=Disagreements over rural economic policies have proven difficult to resolve. As such, beginning today, the members of the politburo will work non-stop on an all-encompassing plan thereof.
ISKO.6.a코0=Let the forces of reaction quiver.

ISKO.7.t코0=Oversight of the Collectivisation Process
ISKO.7.d코0=How the state should bring about reform has caused disagreement among members of the central government. While some, including comrade Peterss, would prefer the central government directly carry out the process of reform, some have called for a more nuanced approach. They argue that the rural people, already inclined towards revolutionary action, could be encouraged to carry out the policy themselves, dispensing with reaction how they see fit. That, they argue, while perhaps more difficult and less comprehensive, would ensure popular support for even more controversial state policies.
ISKO.7.a코0=The state shall act alone.
ISKO.7.b코0=Allow for local implementation.

ISKO.8.t코0=The Expropriation Debate
ISKO.8.d코0=While it is undeniable that central management will rapidly transform rural production networks for the better, short term economic disruption could turn the people against the revolution. As such, some moderates, much to the disdain of Comrade Peterss, call for smaller businesses and landowners to be spared from complete expropriation, even if they are to be brought down a peg.
ISKO.8.a코0=Take it all.
ISKO.8.b코0=Small operations need not be disrupted.

ISKO.9.t코0=On Direct State Ownership
ISKO.9.d코0=In addition to mere collectivisation, some call for the state to take direct control of some agricultural lands.
ISKO.9.a코0=Implement direct state ownership.
ISKO.9.b코0=Push for collectivisation instead.

ISKO.10.t코0=The Kulak Question
ISKO.10.d코0=The rich-peasant Kulak class has long attempted to conceal their exploitative practices beneath a faux-toiler veneer. Without question, the day of reckoning for all deemed to be Kulaks has dawned. some, however, wish to treat the Kulaks more harshly than others. The Kulaks, these moderates argue, can be reformed simply by transforming their relationship with productive forces. They argue that rather than expropriate Kulaks entirely, thy should be allowed to maintain small plots for their own cultivation without the assistance of contracted labourers.
ISKO.10.a코0=Foolish! We must treat them as outright reactionaries.
ISKO.10.b코0=Kulaks can be reformed.

ISKO.11.t코0=The Compensation Debate
ISKO.11.d코0=As part of the collectivisation process, the land and possessions of some otherwise revolutionary-spirited individuals will have to taken by the state. In the interest of equality, many believe even such upright individuals should not receive formal compensation in one form or another, much to the chagrin of some.
ISKO.11.a코0=Ignore the idea.
ISKO.11.b코0=Offer compensation.

ISKO.12.t코0=The Abolition of Private Agriculture
ISKO.12.d코0=With the most contested issues surrounding rural economic policy resolved, a draft has been completed and disseminated throughout the party. As the result of the debates, the politburo has further promulgated a memo affirming the party's intent to ultimately abolish individual ownership of land, framing the much debated policy draft as a step towards that goal.
ISKO.12.a코0=A communist society surely dawns!

ISKO.13.t코0=The Spread of Collectivisation
ISKO.13.d코0=With the most contested issues surrounding rural economic policy resolved, a draft has been completed and disseminated throughout the party. As the result of the debates, the politburo has further promulgated a memo affirming the party's intent to see the gradual amalgamation of all farms into large collective operations without disrupting the countryside, framing the much debated policy draft as a step towards that goal.
ISKO.13.a코0=From the people to the people!

ISKO.14.t코0=Rural Structures Upended
ISKO.14.d코0=Aggressive state policies in pursuit of the abolition of the individual ownership of land have totally upended established informal systems of trade and resource allocation. While this may be necessary in the long run, certain regions have begun to experience profound social, and increasingly economic, turmoil.
ISKO.14.a코0=This could have grave consequences.

ISKO.15.t코0=A Weak Harvest
ISKO.15.d코0=Owing to the disruption in the countryside, entire several large farms have suddenly gone belly-up and left their crops to whither. While central leadership were initially shielded from this grim news, the resulting famine in certain localities has become undeniable. While decisive action to relieve affected areas has now been taken, the bodies are still being counted.
ISKO.15.a코0=A least the worst has passed.

LATFOR.1.t코0=Ultimatum for Dvinsk?
LATFOR.1.d코0=With Russia embroiled in conflict, it seems that now would be an opportune time to bring the Latvians of Dvinsk into the fold. We could send an ultimatum to the socialists in control of Dvinsk, bypassing the white government entirely. Afterall, intervention by even a small power such as ourselves could affect the outcome of the civil war.
LATFOR.1.a코0=Do it.
LATFOR.1.b코0=Back down.

LATFOR.2.t코0=Latvian Provocations
LATFOR.2.d코0=Apparently, the upstart Latvian Republic, a tiny nation by every measure, is planning to make a move for the Latvian-inhabitted Dvinsk region in the near future.
LATFOR.2.a코0=Issue a warning.

LATFOR.3.t코0=Latvian Ultimatum
LATFOR.3.d코0=As expected, Latvia has officially made its move for Dvinsk. Latvian troops have been moved to the border and an ultimatum formally issued - Dvinsk or war.
LATFOR.3.a코0=Even Latvia could prove a challenge.
LATFOR.3.b코0=Laughable. No.

LATFOR.4.t코0=The [FROM.GetName] Accepts
LATFOR.4.d코0=While war was expected, our demands have been met. Dvinsk is ours.
LATFOR.4.a코0=A welcome surprise.

LATFOR.5.t코0=The [FROM.GetNameDef] Refuses
LATFOR.5.d코0=Unsurprisingly, our ultimatum has been rejected. The troops prepare for action in the struggle to unify Latvia.
LATFOR.5.a코0=War it is then.

LATFOR.6.t코0=Latvian State Visit
LATFOR.6.d코0=A delegation has arrived from Latvia headed by President Kurelis. A state dinner has been arranged with leaders vowing to deepen mutual cooperation.
LATFOR.6.a코0=Welcome!

LATFOR.7.t코0=Delegation Welcomed in [FROM.GetName]
LATFOR.7.d코0=Our [FROM.GetNameDef] friends have graciously welcomed our delegation. President Kurelis himself personally attended a formal state dinner and forged new personal connections.
LATFOR.7.a코0=Thank you kindly.

#LATFOR 8-9 removed

LATFOR.10.t코0=A Proposal From Latvia
LATFOR.10.d코0=Latvia has put forth an interesting proposal. Seeking investment from nearby governments and the deepening of economic interdependency, the Latvians have drafted a plan for the creation of a jointly owned industrial holdings company.
LATFOR.10.a코0=An agreeable proposal.
LATFOR.10.b코0=No, thank you.

LATFOR.11.t코0=Offer Accepted
LATFOR.11.d코0=[FROM.GetName] has accepted our proposal. This shall surely deepen economic interdependence.
LATFOR.11.a코0=Great!

LATFOR.12.t코0=Offer Rejected
LATFOR.12.d코0=Despite the obvious economic benefits, [FROM.GetName] has rejected our proposal.
LATFOR.12.a코0=Damn!

LATFOR.13.t코0=Latvian Arms Deal
LATFOR.13.d코0=While they seek to build their own armaments industry, Latvia lacks sufficient arms for the time being. As such, they have requested several thousand small arms as assistance.
LATFOR.13.a코0=We accept.
LATFOR.13.b코0=Tell them to keep their money.

LATFOR.14.t코0=Arms Deal Finalised
LATFOR.14.d코0=[FROM.GetName] has agreed to supply us with a few thousand guns and infantry kit.
LATFOR.14.a코0=Great!

LATFOR.15.t코0=Arms Deal Falls Through
LATFOR.15.d코0=[FROM.GetName] has refused to supply us with arms.
LATFOR.15.a코0=Damn!

LATFOR.16.t코0=A Baltic Trade Area?
LATFOR.16.d코0=Latvia, our old brothers in arms, have proposed the immediate loosening of many trade and border laws in an attempt to solve the structural economic issues caused by the dissolution of the United Baltic Duchy in areas on our shared border. Eventually, the proposed agreement stipulates that we should explore the development of a unified trade policy.
LATFOR.16.a코0=We cannot help but agree.
LATFOR.16.b코0=No, thank you.

LATFOR.17.t코0=Estonia Accepts
LATFOR.17.d코0=Estonia has agreed to develop a common trade policy, immediately lowering certain trade barriers.
LATFOR.17.a코0=As it should be.

LATFOR.18.t코0=Estonia Refuses
LATFOR.18.d코0=Estonia has refused our proposal.
LATFOR.18.a코0=The end of an era.

LATFOR.19.t코0=Common Defence Agreement
LATFOR.19.d코0=Latvia, our old brothers in arms, have proposed an exchange of defence commitments in case the independence of one nation or this other was genuinely threatened in the course of war.
LATFOR.19.a코0=A sound but largely symbolic move.

LATFOR.20.t코0=The Flight of the Latvians
LATFOR.20.d코0=At the prompting of the Latvian government, large numbers of Latvians have started to leave for the new Latvian state.
LATFOR.20.a코0=Good riddance.

LATFOR.21.t코0=Latvia Seeks Protection
LATFOR.21.d코0=Latvia has petitioned to join our military bloc.
LATFOR.21.a코0=Offer it to them.
LATFOR.21.b코0=No. This shall go no further.

LATFOR.22.t코0=Russia Accepts
LATFOR.22.d코0=Russia has accepted. Though in practice we have all but joined their military bloc, ties will be formalised shortly.

LATFOR.24.d코0=Relations with Latvia have soured, and in a shocking move, the aggressive little Latvian state has now all but threatened war, seemingly out of the blue.
LATFOR.24.a코0=We must prepare.

#latfor.25 removed

LATFOR.26.t코0=The Direction of the Military
LATFOR.26.d코0=While all agree on the need to integrate our nation into international trade networks and all of the defence implications involved, the army wishes to decide on its own vision for how it will operate.\nRegardless of whether or not we are alone in the world, or in an alliance with others, the army holds the position that it can either act as if it is part of a larger alliance, or attempt to act as a stand-alone force in its own right.\nThis positioning that the army will take, will affect how it trains and maintains its forces, and prepares them for whatever will happen in the future – regardless of what the political situation of the country is at the time.
LATFOR.26.a코0=The Latvian army will act as\npart of a greater whole.
LATFOR.26.b코0=The Latvian army will operate on\nthe principle of self-sufficiency.

### Focuses ###

LAT_a_new_beginning코0=A New Beginning
LAT_a_new_beginning_desc코0=The ethnic hierarchy of the Latvia that was must be undone. Before we can begin to establish the basic law of the land, we must promulgate broad principles for the achievement of the basic equality of all Latvians.
LAT_convene_the_constituent_assembly코0=Convene The Assembly
LAT_convene_the_constituent_assembly_desc코0=The Bolsheviks and liberals have been overcome. We can at last move towards a more permanent political structure. Latvia is a small and fresh nation that must be built.
LAT_latvia_for_latvians코0=Latvia For Latvians
LAT_latvia_for_latvians_desc코0=While ethnic Letts must form the core of the state and work must be done to dismantle the legacies of imperial domination, we should take care to properly patronise minority populations - Russians and Germans especially. To that end, we must legally discard ethnic classifications in favour of a civic Latvian identity while also taking care to ensure ethnic minorities broad representation in the assembly.
LAT_organize_the_forest_brothers코0=Organise the Forest Brothers
LAT_organize_the_forest_brothers_desc코0=The various rural partisan groups collectively known as the forest brothers lack high-level organisation. While they are respected for their role in bringing about Latvian independence, the state has so far kept them at arms length. We should begin to integrate forest brother units that wish to serve their country yet into the army while demobilising others.
LAT_the_generalis코0=Honour the Generalis
LAT_the_generalis_desc코0=Jānis Kurelis, the Generalis, drove the foreign conquerors from our fair land and freed the people from their chains. In many villages, his noble visage is becoming something of an object of veneration. Statues and other works of art are being commissioned spontaneously. The state should promote this devotion to our leader.
LAT_revise_the_national_territory코0=Geographic Reorientation
LAT_revise_the_national_territory_desc코0=Riga has historically been at the center of Baltic trade networks. We cannot allow one city to dominate so any longer. Optimal routes for a new road and rail networks bypassing Riga should be created and a plan for the realisation of such drafted.

LAT_liquiditate_german_baltic_assets_desc코0=Germans ownership of land and capital both in the cities and the countryside far exceeds their population.

LAT_a_state_economy코0=A State-Led Economy
LAT_a_state_economy_desc코0=In order to ensure that sovereignty and national unity are not eroded through economic channels, the state must entirely control the direction of the economy. Sectors which shall augment our independence must receive state backing.

LAT_Imanta_Regiment_desc코0=The Imanta Regiment succeeded in repelling Bolshevik attacks as German forces looked west. though the regiment, along with other former 'Riflemen' units, are nominally under the command of the army, owing to their outsized renown and influence, they have not been properly integrated into new command structures, nor the insights from their combat history properly internalised by military doctrinaires. This must be remedied.
LAT_ask_for_investment_to_scandinavy코0=Seek Scandinavian Support
LAT_ask_for_investment_to_scandinavy_desc코0=In closer ties with the nations of Scandinavia lies the opportunity to reduce dependency on the European continent's great powers - a necessity if we are to assure our independence in the long-run.
LAT_procuring_russian_investment코0=Russian Rapprochement
LAT_procuring_russian_investment_desc코0=While anti-Russian sentiments remain strong among the Lettish population, cooperation with Russia increasingly seems necessary if our independence is to be guaranteed. We should look to establish strong financial ties with the bear.
LAT_food_export_to_russia코0=Russian Agricultural Exports
LAT_food_export_to_russia_desc코0=Owing to our support for the cultivation of efficient food stuffs, state storehouses overflow with surplus. In order to facilitate greater cooperation with the Russians, we should offer to sell them this surplus at a low price.
LAT_ask_for_russian_equipment코0=Russian Armaments Deal
LAT_ask_for_russian_equipment_desc코0=Russia possesses a vast array of armaments and superior research and development capabilities. With our commitment to Russia growing, we should seek to broker a formal armaments deal.
LAT_economic_deal_with_EST코0=Establish A Baltic Trade Area
LAT_economic_deal_with_EST_desc코0=Trade networks throughout our nation were disrupted as barriers to trade with Estonia went up with the dissolution of the United Baltic Duchy. While stop-gap measures adopted soon after independence have alleviated the situation somewhat, more must be done. We must make a concerted effort to assure free trade with Estonia now and forever.
LAT_Baltic_brothers코0=Blood Brothers
LAT_Baltic_brothers_desc코0=Latvians and Estonians bled together for freedom. Without the other, each of us would still be under the boot today.

LAT_a_return_to_the_homeland코0=Call Our Countrymen Home
LAT_a_return_to_the_homeland_desc코0=Many Russian and diaspora Latvians could be incentivised to return to Latvia. We will need them to work newly opened lands and in the factories if we are to develop economically. We must call our countrymen home.
LAT_an_agrarian_economy코0=Support Agricultural Mechanisation

LAT_an_industrial_need코0=Another Basket
LAT_an_industrial_need_desc코0=Heavy industry cannot be found outside of Riga. Regardless of Riga's status, this reality is to our detriment. The state should plan new industrial parks in the nation's other cities.
LAT_developp_forestry코0=New Forestry System
LAT_developp_forestry_desc코0=While in the past, wood has been sourced careless from old growth forests, new advancements are rapidly transforming forestry throughout the civilised world. A new system for the management and exploitation of the nation's forests should be implemented.
LAT_paper_pulp코0=A Model Mill
LAT_paper_pulp_desc코0=The utilisation of recent breakthroughs in paper production could not only support the logging industry, but hand domestic paper produces a qualitative advantage over foreign competitors. As a proof of concept, a state-owned mill utilising a new recovery boiler for the production of paper pulp should be built, with private producers incentivised to likewise adopt the technology.
LAT_absolute_advantage_on_the_paper코0=Paper Primacy
LAT_absolute_advantage_on_the_paper_desc코0=The paper industry is growing as planned. We can now shift investment towards finished paper products.
LAT_alcohol_production코0=Industrial Libations
LAT_alcohol_production_desc코0=The increasingly industrialised production process of liquor presents opportunities. Such operations could easily be adapted to the production of synthetic fuels during times of war. As such, the state should enter into the ethanol and liquor business on a grand scale.
LAT_space_for_farms코0=Open New Lands
LAT_space_for_farms_desc코0=While much of Latvia is arable, certain areas remain underutilised. The state should take over such places and clear them for cultivation and exploitation.
LAT_food_self_sufficency코0=Strict Agricultural Autarky
LAT_food_self_sufficency_desc코0=While in a time of war, a nation can do without luxury goods, it cannot do without foodstuffs. We must not rely on trade to fill our stomachs. Beyond promoting the cultivation of highly efficient crops like potatoes, the cultivation of cash crops should be discouraged and tariffs on foodstuffs also produced domestically slowly raised.
LAT_hand_estates_to_latvian_landowners코0=Patriotic Privatisation
LAT_hand_estates_to_latvian_landowners_desc코0=Lands newly opened through state efforts should be privatised. We must certain, however, that the right people receive such lands, ethnic Letts currently without land whom possess experience in farming in particular.
LAT_focus_on_hydroelectricity코0=Focus on Hydroelectricity
LAT_focus_on_hydroelectricity_desc코0=Our nation abounds with poorly utilised rivers. The construction of hydroelectric dams would not only provide more electricity than suits our needs, but also allow support our efforts to open new lands to irrigation and agriculture.
LAT_peat_extraction코0=Bogs Into Ploughshares
LAT_peat_extraction_desc코0=The marshes and bogs throughout our nation sit idly while Latvia struggles to enter modernity. They must be put to work. Some can be drained to support farming and the construction of new planned cities tailored towards specific economic sectors.
LAT_rebuild_the_Latvian_armed_forces코0=Centralise Command Structure
LAT_rebuild_the_Latvian_armed_forces_desc코0=With the army itself properly centralised, we should now turn to the sometimes competing officer corps that emerged from the various independence movements. The civilian government must assume responsibility for the process of integrating these groups.
LAT_rebuild_the_Daugavpils_shot_factory코0=Rebuild The Daugavpils Shot Factory
LAT_rebuild_the_Daugavpils_shot_factory_desc코0=The city of Daugavpils has long housed armaments industry with a history spanning centuries. At the end of the Great War, however, the cities machine tools were pilfered and taken to Riga by the Germans. For now, at least, the largest of the old small arms factories must be restored.
LAT_create_the_naval_and_air_forces코0=Round-Out the Armed Forces
LAT_create_the_naval_and_air_forces_desc코0=Besides an army, we must have a navy and an airforce. The patchwork air and naval units currently under the command of the army should be raised to their own independent services.
LAT_lessons_of_1918코0=Lessons of the Weltkrieg
LAT_lessons_of_1918_desc코0=The Weltkrieg saw unparalleled advancement in military doctrine. We must follow the example of the great powers of Europe adn carefully study it.
LAT_create_the_Aizsargi코0=Expand the Aizsargi
LAT_create_the_Aizsargi_desc코0=Originally formed as an auxillary militia force during the struggle for independence, the Aizsargi 'Guards' organisation has swollen nationalist volunteers loyal to the central government alone. As it has outgrown its original purpose, we should reconstitute the organisation as the paramilitary wing of national government and embed its members into the armed forces.
LAT_a_country_on_the_verge_of_war코0=Distributed Defence
LAT_a_country_on_the_verge_of_war_desc코0=Our small nation will likely be under constant threat from larger powers. As such, citizens must be required to keep firearms at home and receive basic martial and ideological training. §GOnce the Latvian army has been completely reorganised, Kurelis may want to extend its borders.§
LAT_our_place_in_Europe코0=A Third Concert
LAT_our_place_in_Europe_desc코0=Though the second concert of Europe was shattered by the Weltkrieg, a new system of alliances and power balancing has emerged. We should join the concert, whether through armed neutrality or the creation of formal military alliances.
LAT_connect_to_global_trade코0=Facilitate Global Trade
LAT_connect_to_global_trade_desc코0=With fledgling industries perhaps ready to compete abroad, we should look to create the physical infrastructure necessary to facilitate international trade.

LAT_the_second_iskolat코0=Second Iskolat Republic
LAT_the_second_iskolat_desc코0=While the first Latvian Socialist Republic was crushed by reactionary forces, the will of the people has now achieved victory. A new socialist Latvia shall emerge.
LAT_a_lettish_red_army코0=Found The Red Army
LAT_a_lettish_red_army_desc코0=While some fear that the army could again become a reactionary fifth column, through careful management and proper ideological training these concerns can be put to rest. We must have a single national army, loyal to the people's party alone.
LAT_reform_the_riflemen코0=Reorganise The Men
LAT_reform_the_riflemen_desc코0=We cannot allow reactionaries to undermine the party through the army. The army must be structured on fundamentally revolutionary ground suited to the conditions of Latvia. The various militias shall be centrally organised only under the auspices of the party itself, their structure unchanged.
LAT_revolution_come_from_countryside코0=Red Peasantry
LAT_revolution_come_from_countryside_desc코0=Much of the support for the revolution came not from the cities, but from the countryside. We must reassess our priorities and focus on providing material benefits towards the peasants and rural labourers.
LAT_there_can_be_only_one코0=Eliminate Internal Contradictions
LAT_there_can_be_only_one_desc코0=Internal reactionary elements have been overcome, but some reactionaries still cling onto power at the local level. The past actions of all office holders must be assessed with proletarian leaders installed at all levels.
LAT_a_new_agriculture코0=Efficient Agriculture
LAT_a_new_agriculture_desc코0=To provide sufficient agricultural surplus, inefficient crops preferred by the merchants of Riga should be replaced entirely with more efficient ones. A nation runs on its stomach, not its decadent niceties.
LAT_a_seize_urbans_goods코0=Begin Urban Restructuring
LAT_a_seize_urbans_goods_desc코0=In the cities, decadence and waste abounds. In order to finance economic restructuring and ensure that urban reactionaries cannot disrupt the process, certain categories of luxury goods must be seized to the last.
LAT_Latvian_socialism코0=The Future of Latvian Socialism
LAT_Latvian_socialism_desc코0=While many in the government sympathise with the idelogical direction of the old Bolsheviks, the ascendency of syndicalism cannot be denied. We must decide whether or not to embrace the syndicalist model.

LAT_look_to_russian_bolshevism_desc코0=Armed with Bolshevik ideology, the path of socialist construction is clear - communism is certainly just over the horizon. We shall not compromise national prosperity for any reason.
LAT_begin_a_five_year_plan코0=Implement Committee Recommendations
LAT_begin_a_five_year_plan_desc코0=Quietly, a central state planning committee was established. While this body, the VPK, has already completed its assessment of the national economy and drawn up several plans for the promotion of heavy industrial, until now, we have been too preoccupied to see its designs through - let us at last implement its central recommendations.\n\n§GThis action can have the effect of getting our economy back on track.§
LAT_collectivization코0=Begin Rural Collectivisation
LAT_collectivization_desc코0=While many who exploited the labour of the rural workers and peasants fled before the revolution, the need to focus on top-level political affairs has since left the countryside in a sort of economic limbo. No longer! The time has come to fundamentally redefine the nature of Latvian agriculture.
LAT_state_farms코0=Communal Experimentation
LAT_state_farms_desc코0=To achieve communism we must move beyond collectivisation. Some state owned agricultural areas can be put to specific use as a sort of living laboratory wherein methods of communal, rather than collective, agricultural are tested.
LAT_take_the_wealth_from_the_kulaks코0=Smash the Kulak Class
LAT_take_the_wealth_from_the_kulaks_desc코0=While most rich peasants have been rightfully expropriated, their stranglehold over rural society remains. They must be definitively dealt with.
LAT_industrialize_the_small_cities코0=New Industrial Network
LAT_industrialize_the_small_cities_desc코0=Heavy industry is all but nonexistant within the nation's smaller cities. If the Latvian people are to progress to a higher state of human development, none must find themselves at such a great distance from economic modernity. We should build new industrial parks in small cities across the nation.
LAT_take_care_of_suburban_workers코0=To Each According to His Need
LAT_take_care_of_suburban_workers_desc코0=Suburban labourers have often been ignored in socialist discourse. Yet it is they who are not necessarily proletarian or peasant who have often formed the core of socialist mass movements. We should reward their support and provide all suburbanites of a proper class background with financial support.
LAT_lettization코0=Lettisation
LAT_lettization_desc코0=Each people must develop a proper national consciousness in order to progress into socialism and ultimately communism. While Latvia is a multiethnic state, it is the Lettish majority which most lacks such a consciousness and requires the state's attention. Ethnic Letts should be officially prioritised in all development initiatives.
LAT_centralise_the_power코0=The Centralist Line
LAT_centralise_the_power_desc코0=The unity of the people's leading party is essential to the proper conduct of socialist government. As such, we much do more yet to combat factionalism and propagate the norms of democratic centralism throughout the party.

LAT_a_syndicalist_model_desc코0=Syndicalism has ended bourgeoisie economic and political domination in some of the most powerful nations on the planet, and its merits cannot be denied.

LAT_call_the_exiles코0=Recalling the Exiles
LAT_call_the_exiles_desc코0=Many Latvian socialists fled abroad with the suppression of the October Revolution. We should facilitate both their return and the return of other ideologically upright Latvians abroad.
LAT_world_revolution코0=Global Fraternity
LAT_world_revolution_desc코0=A fledgling socialist state like ours has much to learn from the juggernauts of the Third Internationale.

If decisions must occasionally be made, in part at least, from Paris or London, so be it.
LAT_french_political_advisors코0=French Political Advisors
LAT_french_political_advisors_desc코0=Syndicalism has become the accepted political orthodoxy in the Commune of France. The people engage with the political system entirely within a properly syndicalist framework. We should secure French political advisors in order to accomplish such a cultural transformation domestically.
LAT_hold_totalist_exposition코0=A Living Exposition
LAT_hold_totalist_exposition_desc코0=Liepaja is relatively unremarkable in the eyes of the syndicalist powers. We shall remake it grander than anything yet seen. The city should be slowly rebuilt entirely, streets widened drastically, tenements replaced with monuments to the victory of syndicalism and modern multi-story housing complexes constructed on the basis of efficiency.
LAT_prepare_for_urban_warfare코0=Urban Warfare Training
LAT_prepare_for_urban_warfare_desc코0=While in the past, men cowered behind city walls before the enemy, cities themselves have become a nigh-impervious obstacle for invading armies in the modern day.

LAT_centralized_high_command코0=Centralised High Command
LAT_centralized_high_command_desc코0=For a smaller force like ours, strategic cohesion trumps tactical flexibility. We must establish a strategic planning office and train the men to obey central orders to the letter regardless of conditions on the ground.
LAT_technologies_for_the_army코0=Focus on Armoured Warfare
LAT_technologies_for_the_army_desc코0=While many hold firm to the military orthodoxy developed during the Weltkrieg, we know that technological advancements shall make the next war very different from the last. A mechanised army supported by armour can punch far above its weight.
LAT_indoctrinate_youth코0=Military-Youth League Integration
LAT_indoctrinate_youth_desc코0=The national youth movement, effective in ensuring martial prowess and ideological correctness among the populace, should be placed under the auspices of the armed forces, with youth league leaders, staunch supporters of the party line, likewise given a degree of oversight of military affairs.
LAT_revolutionnary_soldiers코0=Play To Our Advantages
LAT_revolutionnary_soldiers_desc코0=Above all else, a model socialist man is disciplined and vigilant. Let us apply lessons learned in the civilian sector to the military, ensuring order and discipline in the ranks.
LAT_create_an_economic_department코0=Department of Industrial Affairs
LAT_create_an_economic_department_desc코0=While we shall not cede central political authority to labour unions, in line with the ideals of syndicalism, local unions must have a role in administration. We should create an administrative body within the auspices of the party itself, not the state, to oversee the inevitably complicated de jure relationship of the party with the various unions carrying out the party line.\n\n§GThis action can have the effect of getting our economy back on track.§
LAT_decentralize_industries코0=Establish Industrial Juristdictions

LAT_organize_trad_union_councils코0=Organise Union Councils
LAT_organize_trad_union_councils_desc코0=In order to disincentivise unions from attempting to undermine central authority, they must have a direct line of contact with representatives of the central state.

LAT_foregin_equipment코0=Ensure Armaments Flow
LAT_foregin_equipment_desc코0=In the near term at least, domestic armament production will certainly remain insufficient. We should secure a regular flow of arms from the Commune of France.
LAT_guerilla_warfare코0=A Guerilla Army
LAT_guerilla_warfare_desc코0=We cannot hope to defeat one of the great powers of Europe in a set-piece battle. Through asymmetric warfare, however, we can impose unacceptable costs on any invading foe. We must orient our forces towards the exploitation of the terrain and weather.
LAT_gun_in_every_hand코0=A Gun In Every Hand
LAT_gun_in_every_hand_desc코0=Reactionaries possess an undeniable material advantage. We must focus on the simplification of armaments in order to facilitate sufficient levels of production to make up for this.
LAT_mobilize_the_people코0=Cult of the Volunteer
LAT_mobilize_the_people_desc코0=Ideas can inspire dedication. Rather than implementing a harsh conscription policy with its own drawbacks, we should focus on the romanticisation of combat and volunteer fighters in the popular image.
LAT_workers_in_the_war코0=Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers
LAT_workers_in_the_war_desc코0=The synthesis between military and civilian life must be total. Martial training must be established in all places of business to prepare workers for the inevitable bloody struggle against reaction.
LAT_purge_the_opposition코0=The Patriotic Front
LAT_purge_the_opposition_desc코0=It is inevitable that certain elements will hold views at odds with the people and their great party. We should bring some such individuals into the national parliament contingent on their loyalty to the party and acceptance of its leading political position, while those who refuse to uphold these principles shall be made examples of publically. Perhaps these comrades in all but name can lead unsavoury elements into the light.
LAT_a_new_october코0=Political Correctness
LAT_a_new_october_desc코0=The people are the party and the party is the people. Our nation must be one cohesive entity. To ensure that the ideals of the revolution and especially the principle of democratic centralism are upheld, the private sphere and the public sphere must become one and the same. State security officials should embed themselves amongst the masses, enforcing the party line and given the autonomy to act as judge and jury in their dealings with reactionary elements.
LAT_a_war_industry코0=Implement Armaments Industry Plan
LAT_a_war_industry_desc코0=The VPK has drawn up a second plan for the proliferation of armaments industry across newly industrialised areas. With the basis for socialist construction established, we should implement the plan.
LAT_agrarian_reforms코0=Proletarianisation
LAT_agrarian_reforms_desc코0=The rural peasantry, influenced by Bolshevism, enabled the establishment of socialism in Latvia. We must win them over to the new syndicalist party line.

Though these unions, the new norms of the party can be instilled.
LAT_peterss_revolution코0=The Great Liberator
LAT_peterss_revolution_desc코0=Comrade Peterss was central to the victory of the revolution and the embrace of syndicalism alike. The people must be encourage to value his leadership with every fibre of their being.

LAT_internationale_advisors코0=Communard Tactical Expertise
LAT_internationale_advisors_desc코0=The French have learned much from their defeat in the Weltkrieg, casting aside old and ineffective doctrine in favour of the new. We should request Communard experts to assist in the modernisation of our forces.
