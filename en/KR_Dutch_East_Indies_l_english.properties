### Leaders ###
POLITICS_DE_JONGE_DESC코0=A moderate conservative Jonkheer, De Jonge first rose to national prominence as chief legal minister during in 1910, and as interim minister of war during the Weltkrieg, his political standing was cemented. After a successful stint with the Batavian Oil Company, which was responsible for petroleum extraction and refinement in the East Indies, De Jonge was appointed governor-general of the East Indian colony. Something of a strongman, De Jonge has focused great effort on suppression of the emerging nationalist movement.

POLITICS_STACHOUWER_DESC코0=Jonkheer Alidius Warmoldus Lambertus Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer, is a Dutch nobleman and statesman. He has always been a dutiful civil servant and appears to be wishing to remove some authoritarian measures, but ultimately wishes maintain the status quo of the colony.


### Events ###
dei.1.t코0=The Indies in 1936
dei.1.d코0=Barring the syndicalist revolt in 1925, the crown jewel of the Dutch empire has been a beacon of stability, taking advantage of Dutch ascension into Mitteleuropa to sell its goods (sugar, coffee, oil) to the newly opened up markets. Despite the competition from the now properly set-up and rebuilt German competition, this economic growth managed to keep up and stability came along with it.\nDespite this, Dutch authorities suppress any call for independence, with the Dutch government believing they will not be able to survive without 'de oost', but despite this, the movements grow. Many in the colonial administration fear that if economic hardship were to appear again, events like 1925 might repeat, or worse...
dei.1.a코0=But economic hardship seems miles away!

dei.2.t코0=Black Monday Hits the Indies
dei.2.d코0=The result of the economic hardship that hit Europe after the Black Monday crash could soon be felt in the Dutch East Indies too, who had been selling their goods on the Mitteleuropa market since the end of the Weltkrieg. As the common man in Europe could no longer afford to purchase goods such as sugar and coffee, the prices of said goods imploded, with deep implications for the farmers here.
dei.2.a코0=Oh no!

dei.3.t코0=Growing Unity in Independence Movements
dei.3.d코0=The PID is reporting that the unity among independence movements has been growing lately. It would be prudent to keep a watchful eye over them and to stop them from growing stronger (and preferably weakening their unity), lest their collaboration result in a stronger movement overall.
dei.3.a코0=We'll be vigilant!

dei.4.t코0=Falling Unity in Independence Movements
dei.4.d코0=The PID is reporting that the unity among independence movements is faltering and now even falling. While it would be unwise to sit back and relax now, we will have less problems controlling them soon as cracks in their collaboration begin to show.
dei.4.a코0=That's great!

dei.5.t코0=Strength of the Independence Movements Grows
dei.5.d코0=The PID reports that the movements propagating the independence of Insulindia are growing in strength. We might want to consider being more careful in delicate situations, and to crack down on them where we can, lest we become unable to control them.
dei.5.a코0=Worrying...

dei.6.t코0=Strength of the Independence Movements Falters
dei.6.d코0=The PID reports that the movements propagating the independence of Insulindia are losing punching power. While we should remain vigilant, as they are not dead, we can rule slightly more relaxed in the near future as it will be easier to control them in the short term.
dei.6.a코0=Great!

dei.7.t코0=Governor-General De Jonge Resigns
dei.7.d코0=Our Governor-General Bonifacius de Jonge had mentioned multiple times that he intended to resign from his post as governor-general of the Indies, but delayed it in the light of the Dutch elections, that were increasingly showing to become an electoral feast for his patron party, the VNH, back in the Netherlands. For better or worse, the elections are over now, and it will remain to be seen who the new minister of colonies will appoint as his replacement.
dei.7.a코0=We await the decision with joy!

dei.8.t코0=A Replacement for the Governor-General
dei.8.d코0=The Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, Bonifacius Cornelis de Jonge has announced his intend to resign, having waited for the election to do this so that the new government could appoint the new governor-general without the need of him being replaced within half a year which would, in De Jonge's eyes, be harmful for the stability of the Indies.\nMultiple candidates have come forward, but only one can become Governor-General...
dei.8.a코0=Nico Palar, who will rule with a soft hand.
dei.8.b코0=A. Tjarda van Starkenborgh-Stachouwer, the balanced candidate.
dei.8.c코0=Johan Furstner, who will keep the Inlanders under control by force!

dei.9.t코0=Governor-General Nico Palar
dei.9.d코0=The Ministry of Colonies has decided to appoint the social democrat Nicodemus Palar as our new Governor-General, who is also the first Inlander governor-general of the colony. The new Governor-General is expected to rule the Indies through compromise, working towards an equal status within the kingdom or even national independence.\nNeedless to say, the white ruling class and the Indo-Dutch community are somewhat worried by this development, fearing the end of the East Indies as they know it. On the other hand, Inlanders are very happy with this change.
dei.9.a코0=Welcome, your excellence!

dei.10.t코0=Governor-General A. Tjarda van Starkenborgh-Stachouwer
dei.10.d코0=The ministry of colonies has decided to appoint Alidius Tjarda van Starkenborgh-Stachouwer as our new Governor-General, as most had expected, considering his career. The new Governor-General is expected to try to keep a balance between repression and compromise with hopes to someday give the Indies equal status within the kingdom.\nThe white ruling class and the Indo-Dutch community approve of this choice, while the Inlanders are indifferent.
dei.10.a코0=Welcome, your excellence!

dei.11.t코0=Governor-General Johan Furstner
dei.11.d코0=The ministry of colonies has decided to appoint the VNH-strongman Johan Furstner as our new Governor-General, the preferred choice as successor of now-former governor-general De Jonge. The new Governor-General is expected to act strongly, putting down nationalism by force and reinforcing the status-quo of Dutch rule. Equal status is not on the agenda.\nThe white ruling class and the Indo-Dutch community are very pleased with this choice of a hardliner, but it's unlikely the Inlanders will be happy with it.
dei.11.a코0=Welcome, your excellence!

dei.12.t코0=You encountered a bug!
dei.12.d코0=You encountered a bug related to the Dutch East Indies. Please report this to GitHub and tag Thomahawk2k. Thank you for your time.
dei.12.a코0=Of course I will report this!

dei.13.t코0=Proclamation of Insulindian Independence
dei.13.d코0=With the recent growth of the Insulindian independence movement, it probably does not come as a surprise: Sukarno has issued a proklamasi, proclamation, calling upon all Insulindians to resist the Dutch occupier and to join the Tentara Keselamatan Rakyat, the People's Safety Army. It seems an outright revolt to remove Dutch rule from the Insulindian archipelago has erupted.
dei.13.a코0=Bersiap! (Play Insulindia)
dei.13.b코0=Bereid de Politionele Acties Voor! (Play Dutch East Indies)

dei.14.t코0=Dutch Armouries Overrun
dei.14.d코0=As the opening stages of the Insulindian National Revolution have arrived, our brave troops have raided Dutch armouries across Java and Sumatra for the guns stored there. They will be put to good use in driving the colonial menace from our homeland!
dei.14.a코0=Long live the Republic!

dei.15.t코0=TKR Raids Armouries
dei.15.d코0=Insulindian republican forces have raided armouries across the countries for guns, quickly overrunning them with their superior numbers. While the casualty rate is small, we have lost several batches of guns to the Republican Army of Insulindia, which could pose a problem later.
dei.15.a코0=Oh no!

dei.16.t코0=Volksraad Passes the Sutardjo-Petition
dei.16.d코0=The Volksraad, the largely powerless 'parliament' of our colony, has passed a petition of Soetardjo Kartohadikoesoemo, calling for a conference to speak about the future of the Dutch East Indies, specifically in terms of promoting it to an equal status within the kingdom. With it being passed it is now the task of the Governor-General to send it back home. The Volksraad is merely an advisory legislature however, and the Dutch and Indo population is concerned about the implications of the petition, so we could also simply veto the whole deal.
dei.16.a코0=Veto, of course!
dei.16.b코0=Let's send it to the Netherlands.

dei.17.t코0=The Sutardjo-Petition
dei.17.d코0=A petition that has been passed by the Volksraad has arrived on the desk of prime minister Colijn, having been sent to us by the Governor-General [DEI.GetLeader]. Apparently, the petition calls for a congress to speak about the future of the status of the Dutch East Indies within the kingdom. The Volksraad has already removed all time limits the original proposal included, so the prime minister made his choice already when to handle it in the house of representatives.
dei.17.a코0=... somewhere next year sounds good!

dei.18.t코0=Sutardjo-Petition in the House
dei.18.d코0=As decided by Hendrik Colijn about a year ago, the Sutardjo-Petition has been brought up at the house of representatives, calling for a congress about the revision of the status of the Dutch East Indies, specifically towards the promotion of an equal status within the kingdom. When the vote is held, the petition is...
dei.18.a코0=... accepted: tell the colonial government to hold a congress when they're ready!
dei.18.b코0=... rejected: any such proposal should be regulated by the Netherlands.

dei.19.t코0=Sutardjo-Petition Rejected
dei.19.d코0=The homeland has rejected the Sutardjo-Petition we've sent to them about a year ago, with most of those voting against it citing the fact that the Dutch East Indies is an overseas territory and not a colony that can be uplifted to equal status. Obviously, the real reason is that they think the Insulindians aren't ready for self-rule, and it seems obvious that the Insulindians won't be happy with this.
dei.19.a코0=All's well that ends well!

dei.20.t코0=Sutardjo-Petition Accepted
dei.20.d코0=The homeland has accepted the Sutardjo-Petition we've sent to them about a year ago, although they did remove all the time limits. They know full well the implications of such a conference, so assurances are sought that we handle it with care, and only when we are ready. The door, however, is open for promoting the Indies to an equal status.
dei.20.a코0=The Inlanders will be pleased.

dei.21.t코0=Formation of GAPI
dei.21.d코0=As a result of the rejection of their plan for a conference, all Inlander parties (with exception of the PNI) have merged into a singular Insulindian Political Federation, calling for the full implementation of an Insulindian parliament and thus for Insulindian equal status once more. As the Dutch government is obviously unwilling to fulfil this wish, especially in the light of rising international tensions, this will only help unite the Inlanders in the independence movement.
dei.21.a코0=Why does this always have to happen to me?!

dei.22.t코0=The Round-Table Conference
dei.22.d코0=The Dutch have shown their inability to quash our rebellion, and with the international community starting to notice our plight, their position is becoming increasingly unstable. We will likely be able to negotiate a favourable deal - establishing sovereignty over all the Insulindian archipelago.
dei.22.a코0=The day has come!

dei.23.t코0=The Round-Table Conference
dei.23.d코0=Having been unable to quell the rebellion and with republican forces holding sway over virtually all of Java and Sumatra, it seems impossible to maintain our position in our colony. The republicans have put forward their demands: full sovereignty over all of the Indies, but perhaps we can at least salvage parts of our colony?
dei.23.a코0=Sign the treaty.
dei.23.b코0=We will not give up New Guinea!
dei.23.c코0=We will not give up New Guinea or the Moluccas!
dei.23.e코0=We will not give up at all!

dei.24.t코0=The Dutch Sign the Treaty!
dei.24.d코0=The Dutch have agreed to transfer all sovereignty over the Indies to the republic of Insulindia. This is a great day for our country, and will be remembered by the generations after us, for today Insulindia became officially an independent country, free from imperialism!
dei.24.a코0=Merdeka has been achieved!

dei.25.t코0=The Dutch Make Counterdemands!
dei.25.d코0=Citing the impossibility of getting the needed support to pull through the amendment to the constitution to allow for the transfer of sovereignty, the Dutch say they need to retain sovereignty over Western Irian (New Guinea). While this is a setback, it seems unlikely at current that we will be able to take the island by force as we lack the Dutch naval capacity. Perhaps we're better served agreeing with this deal than to continue hostilities: they'll agree to concede the much more valuable rest of the archipelago after all...
dei.25.a코0=We'll sign, we'll get West Irian later!
dei.25.b코0=This is unacceptable.

dei.26.t코0=The Insulindians Refuse!
dei.26.d코0=The republican delegation was outraged by our unwillingness to concede all of the former East Indies to them. It seems negotiations have broken down and the war will continue.
dei.26.a코0=The land wasn't even worth a lot!

dei.27.t코0=The Dutch Make Counterdemands!
dei.27.d코0=Citing the impossibility of getting the needed support to pull through the amendment to the constitution to allow for the transfer of sovereignty, the Dutch say they need to retain sovereignty over Western Irian (New Guinea) and the Christian Moluccas, who have continuously been supporting them during the revolution. While this is a setback, it seems unlikely at current that we will be able to take the islands by force as we lack the Dutch naval capacity. Perhaps we're better served agreeing with this deal than to continue hostilities: they'll agree to concede the much more valuable rest of the archipelago after all...
dei.27.a코0=We'll make this work...
dei.27.b코0=Insulindia without its east isn't Insulindia!

dei.28.t코0=The Dutch Refuse!
dei.28.d코0=Despite clearly having been outmatched by the republican forces, the stubborn Dutch still refuse to sign a treaty with 'outlaws and thugs'. It seems we'll have to continue our struggle until they'll finally lose their spirit.
dei.28.a코0=A setback indeed!

dei.29.t코0=Volunteers in the Insulindian Revolution
dei.29.d.sentvolunteers코0=As we know, a revolt has flared up in the Dutch East Indies, with the native population seeking to secure their independence from their Dutch overlords. We have already sent them attaché military divisions, but it seems that there are some concerned citizens wishing to travel to the Indies themselves to help. Should we allow them to complement our military aid there?
dei.29.d.sentnovolunteers코0=A revolt has flared up in the Dutch East Indies, with the native population seeking to secure their independence from their Dutch overlords. Many in our countries feel connected to the Insulindian plight and want to help. Shall we send a detachment of volunteers?
dei.29.a코0=Of Course!
dei.29.b코0=Rather not!

dei.290.t코0=Send Volunteers to the Dutch East Indies
dei.290.d코0=As we know, a revolt has flared up in the Dutch East Indies, with the native population seeking to secure their independence from their Dutch overlords. Though we have never really seen eye to eye with the Dutch, they still provided a level of stability to the region, and like us, see the Japanese as a threat to that stability. Though we cannot overtly join the current conflict, we could send in volunteers to assist the Dutch Government and hold their hand like we have had to do in the past.
dei.290.a코0=Of course, not here to fornicate with spiders.
dei.290.b코0=They made their bed, they can lay in it

dei.30.t코0=[From.GetNameDefCap] Sends Volunteers
dei.30.d.INS코0=Feeling connected to the plight of the Insulindians, or in opposition of the Dutch imperialists, [From.GetAdjective] volunteers have arrived to help us with our struggle.
dei.30.d.DEI코0=In support of their Dutch allies, or fearing the growing Insulindian revolution, [From.GetAdjective] volunteers have arrived to help us with our struggle.
dei.30.a코0=We can use their help!

dei.31.t코0=Foreign Volunteers Return Home
dei.31.d코0=For better or for worse, the Insulindian National Revolution is over now and volunteers that arrived in the Indies to join the TKR from distant lands are returning to their home country.
dei.31.a코0=Bye... I guess...

dei.310.t코0=Foreign Volunteers Return Home
dei.310.d코0=For better or for worse, the Insulindian National Revolution is over now and volunteers that arrived in the Indies to join the KNIL from distant lands are returning to their home country.
dei.310.a코0=Bye... I guess...

dei.32.t코0=Insulindian Volunteers Return Home
dei.32.d코0=The volunteers we've sent to the Insulindian revolt have returned, now that peace has been restored in the Insulindian archipelago. They bring some experience in fighting in hard terrain back with them...
dei.32.a코0=Welcome back!

dei.320.t코0=Dutch East Indies Volunteers Return Home
dei.320.d코0=The volunteers we've sent to the Insulindian revolt have returned, now that peace has been restored in the Dutch East Indies archipelago. They bring some experience in fighting in hard terrain back with them...
dei.320.a코0=Things we do for those Dutch bastards

dei.35.t코0=The Netherlands Abandons the Indies
dei.35.d코0=Disturbing news has arrived from the Indies: the socialists who gained power in the homeland have overthrown the old order through their parliamentary position, and now they have ordered us to protect all Dutch citizens in Insulindia and help them move to the Netherlands if they so desire and to safeguard an orderly retreat from the area. Unsurprisingly, chaos ensued, with Sukarno, just released from prison, taking advantage of the situation to declare Insulindian independence. Meanwhile the Governor-General is missing, and mercenaries took over control our part of the island of Borneo. The Indies are collapsing just because of this statement.
dei.35.a코0=Switch to the Batavian Commune.
dei.35.b코0=Switch to Insulindia.

dei.36.t코0=Anarchy in the Dutch East Indies
dei.36.d코0=The socialist government on the Netherlands suddenly abandoned their colony, declaring their own presence illegal and instructing their military presence to protect Dutch civilians that want to return now. The first reports indicate that Sukarno and his national party will take control over the Indies, who will at best be indifferent to our rule, and at worst hostile. While a military expedition to pacify the Indies is asking for trouble, we could decide to move to take as much of formerly Dutch New Guinea as possible and secure the formerly Dutch side of the strait of Malacca.
dei.36.a코0=Ready the ships!
dei.36.b코0=I don't feel like it...

dei.37.t코0=The Germans Violate Our Sovereignty
dei.37.d코0=Concerned with our attitude to their rule and the balance of power in the region, the Germans have sent ships to secure the Sumatran side of the Malacca strait, as well as moving into New Guinea from Kaiser-Wilhelmsland. Sadly, with the current chaos due to the sudden Dutch retreat we can do very little against it.
dei.37.a코0=Oh no!

dei.38.t코0=German Presence in New Guinea
dei.38.d코0=The socialist government in the Netherlands suddenly pulled out of the Dutch East Indies. The local populace, led by the prominent nationalist Sukarno, declared their own sovereign state: Insulindia. Unsurprisingly, the Germans decided that this was the ideal moment to take over Western New Guinea. If we are to prevent the Germans to take all of it, we better move fast!
dei.38.a코0=We can't let them do that!
dei.38.b코0=We don't have the resources.

dei.39.t코0=Southwestern New Guinea Ripe for the Taking
dei.39.d코0=We expected the Australasians to sweep in and block us in taking the southern part of Dutch New Guinea, but this does not seem to have happened. The land is open, and our forces are moving into the formerly Dutch forts in the area.
dei.39.a코0=Unexpected, but welcome.

dei.40.t코0=[From.GetNameDefCap] Seizes Southwestern Irian
dei.40.d코0=[From.GetAdjective] forces swept in and occupied southwestern Irian. This is insulting and factually unacceptable but due to the chaos of the Dutch retreat, there is little we can do about it...
dei.40.a코0=Unacceptable!

dei.41.t코0=Congress of Batavia - Start
dei.41.d코0=The Congress of Batavia started, representatives from all over the Indies have arrived to negotiate over the future of the Dutch East Indies and it being raised to equal status with the Netherlands.\nThe first contentious issue is what these new countries within the kingdom will be. Most nationalists seem to favour a solution where Java and Sumatra are united, Borneo and Celebes are their own countries and another state called 'East Insulindia' which includes the Moluccas and overall, the Christian part of the land. Many (Dutch and Eastern Indonesian) are afraid however, that such a Java-Sumatra state would go on to dominate the new kingdom of the Netherlands and would rather see both islands be split up into several countries. Then, there is the middle ground, where both Java and Sumatra are their own countries within the kingdom.
dei.41.a코0=Keeping the countries small and controllable is preferable.
dei.41.b코0=The middle ground: they give something, we give something.
dei.41.c코0=Java and Sumatra united seems most reasonable.

dei.42.t코0=Congress of Batavia
dei.42.d코0=The next contentious issue is the way the kingdom would be ruled overall. The countries within the kingdom have full internal autonomy, but some oversight should there, especially when changes need to be made to the constitution, all representatives agree on that. The Dutch argue that the Netherlands should lead this group with all other countries sending their representative to the council of ministers of the kingdom. The Insulindian representatives strongly reject that notion, declaring that it would be undemocratic, and that each country should be represented in this council dependent on its population.
dei.42.a코0=No, this still is the Netherlands...
dei.42.b코0=Representation according to population is only fair!

dei.43.t코0=Congress of Batavia
dei.43.d코0=Several smoothly agreed upon issues came along, when another highly contentious one appeared near the end of the conference: foreign policy. Obviously, the countries stand together under the kingdom, but the Dutch want to control foreign policy when it doesn't directly concern any of the other countries, while the Insulindians would much rather see a unified foreign ministry that is set up by the autonomous countries together. Once this issue is resolved, it will be voted on by the States-General.
dei.43.a코0=We are obviously right...
dei.43.b코0=The Insulindians are right.

dei.44.t코0=The Outcome of the Batavia Conference
dei.44.d.dutch코0=The delegates at the Batavia conference have come to a conclusion. It is clear that the conference was pushed significantly to the pro-Dutch side, and it doesn't seem like the Insulindians were very happy with it. It is probably enough to secure limited cooperation, but not enthusiasm except in the Moluccas perhaps.
dei.44.d.balanced코0=The delegates at the Batavia conference have come to a conclusion. It is clear that the conference was a good mix between pro-Dutch and pro-native policies, and while perhaps, secretly, both the Dutch and Insulindians had hoped for more, neither is dissatisfied with it either. It is probably enough to secure anything but limited cooperation in the western part of the Dutch East Indies, but at least there is a lot of enthusiasm about this solution in the Moluccas, lesser Sunda islands and Western New Guinea.
dei.44.d.insulindia코0=The delegates at the Batavia conference have come to a conclusion. It is clear that the conference was weighted towards the Insulindian side, making many Dutch people uncomfortable, feeling like their country will never be the same anymore. The Insulindians are happy with it however, especially outside Java, Sumatra and Borneo.
dei.44.a코0=The proposal is accepted!
dei.44.b코0=The proposal is rejected!

dei.47.t코0=The States-General Rejects the Proposal
dei.47.d코0=The States-General unexpectedly rejected our proposal for the new Insulindian status in the near future. Needless to say, the Insulindians are not amused with this sudden rejection of their rights!
dei.47.a코0=This could become problematic.

dei.48.t코0=Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands
dei.48.d코0=After significant negotiations, it is time to sign the Koninkrijksstatuut; the royal charter. In this, our colonial possessions become autonomous countries within the kingdom, ruling themselves while still being part of the kingdom of the Netherlands, and subjects from each country will get Dutch citizenship. It also should note that independence has been promised, though clauses have been written in to ensure this happens in decades not years...
dei.48.a코0=Long live the Dutch Kingdom!

dei.49.t코0=Equal Status Granted!
dei.49.d코0=As per what was agreed upon in the Batavia Conference, the Dutch East Indies will now cease to exist: divided into several autonomous countries within the Dutch Kingdom. Full internal autonomy will fall to these states and all Dutch East Indian subjects will be granted Dutch citizenship.
dei.49.a코0=Long live the Dutch Kingdom!
dei.49.b코0=Long live the Dutch Kingdom, and the people of Insulindia

dei.51.t코0=Reinforcements Arrive
dei.51.d코0=As per the preparations we have made, reinforcements have arrived to help fend off native revolts and/or foreign invasions of the Indies.
dei.51.a코0=Glad to see them arrive!

dei.52.t코0=[DEI.GetLeader] Dissolves the Volksraad
dei.52.d코0=Early in the morning, governor-general [DEI.GetLeader] issued a decree suspending the volksraad once and for all, proclaiming the institution was only meant to make Dutch rule weaker and only helps outlaws like Sukarno. From now on loyalty to the crown will be the foremost goal of the Dutch East Indies and not the petty complaints of the small Inlander majority in the volksraad that previously had to be consulted. Some critics say this is more to extend [DEI.GetLeader]'s personal power, but this is clearly nonsensical.
dei.52.a코0=It was the right thing to do!

dei.53.t코0=[DEI.GetLeader] Dissolves the Volksraad
dei.53.d코0=News has arrived from the Dutch East Indies, where the governor-general has suspended the volksraad, the legislative body that already didn't have a lot of power, for a currently unknown amount of time - possibly forever. He argues that the body was being used by Inlanders to undermine Dutch rule.
dei.53.a코0=If it's for the good of our rule, it's justified!

dei.54.t코0=The Dutch Issue Greater Taxes
dei.54.d코0=With the black Monday crisis haunting the Dutch homeland, the Dutch government decided to issue additional production-obligations from us, not considering the fact that the crisis had hit our industries right here too. Unsurprisingly, while this action will help the Netherlands, it will make our work harder, as independence activists get greater steam arguing that we are only here to exploit them.
dei.54.a코0=This is a mistake!

dei.59.t코0=Anarchy in the Dutch West Indies
dei.59.d코0=A disturbing turn of events has happened: the native population in Insulindia, the basis of the Dutch exiles has ousted their former colonial master. With its head cut off the snake once more, the Dutch empire is no more: upon the news reaching the west indies, anarchy has struck these colonies. Now we have no choice but to occupy them.
dei.59.a코0=It is our humanitarian duty.

dei.60.t코0=Enticing Foreign Pilots
dei.60.d코0=The Air Corp of the KNIL is lacking the basic, from a suitable aerodrome, to support staff on the ground to maintain the aircraft that it currently has. These issues are being addressed by the newly formed Netherlands Purchasing Commission, though the main issue at hand is pilots. This stems from the main issue of a limited number of suitable men from the Netherlands, and Dutch East Indies willing to join the Air Corp.\n\nA solution to this is the hiring of foreign pilots, to fill in the gap till a proper solution can be found, though like any hiring process, what are we going to offer these foreign pilots that they cannot get in German Ostasien, or Mittelafrika?
dei.60.a코0=A tough decision, what did those Belgians do in the Kongo again?

dei.61.t코0=[GetYear] Review of the KNIL
dei.61.d코0=Since the mid-19th century, the Netherlands has maintained a position of neutrality between the world's powers. With the Weltkrieg showing that neutrality of a nation isn't a guarantee to avoid war, and tensions slowly rising again in Europe, between the Syndicalist nations of England, and France, and the Imperialistic German Empire, a different narrative is occurring within its far flung colony.\nWith the Japanese Empire, and German Ostasien preparing what appears to be the battle for Asia, and the Syndicalist moving within Australasian nation, the KNIL (Koninklijk Nederlands Indisch Leger) is nowhere ready to provide an adequate defence for the colony, with it currently only able to defend Java Island.\n\nThe KNIL role is mainly for maintaining peace within the colony, and as of late, suppressing the indigenous population where the local Police forces are unable to handle this. It lacks modern arms, a command-and-control structure, and the other basic needs that are currently being address with a new budget being drawn, and the slow merging of several commissions to help streamline the modernisation of the KNIL.
dei.61.a코0=Ons kostbaarste sieraad

dei.62.t코0=Review of the Nederlands-Indische Vloot
dei.62.d코0=Upon completion of the review of the Dutch East Indies fleet, the current naval assets cannot provide adequate defence of the archipelagos. The silver lining of the assessment was that the Dutch East Indies fleet has been able to combat pirating in the area. Admiral Helfrich has been given the authority to rectify this via his “Vlootplan”.\n\nIn the Netherlands itself, his Vlootplan has rubbed many the wrong way for promoting submarines, opposed to that of Pansterships. It would see the promotion of \"Guerrilla  Warfare\" tactics by the fleet, in Helfrich dubbed \"Guerrilla  Plan\". This aside, this Vlootplan is a boon for the fledgling Dutch East Indies fleet, whose sailors are more than eager to prove themselves.

dei.63.t코0=Cultuurstelsel-Apartheid System Enforced
dei.63.d코0=[DEI.GetLeader] end goal for the Dutch East Indies was to revert it back to the cultivation system that existed in the 19th century, with the Dutch East Indies being nothing but a cash cow for the Dutch to milk. Though it also appears that an extra layer has been added, with the segregation of the European population, and the natives, with those falling in the middle being deemed to be \"appropriate\" or not by the government. The local independent movements have bene growing, with the use of \"politionele acties\" becoming more and more the norm, with the real question to be asked, how long will this last...?
dei.63.a코0=Gekoloniseerd

dei.64.t코0=A New Beginning
dei.64.d코0=With the Koninkrijksstatuut signed, a level of equality has been given too all within the archipelagos. Though these new nations/states have face social and/or economic problems, they all seem eagerly to show they themselves can handle these challenges.\n\nThough it would appear that the Javanese and Malay nations/states are seeking to expedite the independence process, with many more wishing for a more \"Unitary\" state opposed to a broken federation...
dei.64.a코0=Interesting
dei.64.b코0=Fine fine

dei.65.t코0=A New Volksraad
dei.65.d코0=Though the Dutch East Indies has been essentially broken up into smaller states, that range from autonomous regions under the Netherlands, to large states with who are all but nations in their own right, they all still seek representation, and change within the halls of the dubbed "old Volksraad".n\nEven with the new reforms, and the Koninkrijksstatuut signed, Javanese-Malay representatives have somewhat unified to \"accelerate\" the progress to break away completely from the Dutch rule. Not all states have the same vision of a unified \"Insulindia\" with those representatives of Timor, Malacca, and Papua content with the current affair of things, and fear a "Javanese" take over. Either way, the Javanese-Malay have formed a majority within the this \"New Volksraad\", and demand they be debated on.
dei.65.a코0=Here we go again

dei.66.t코0=Week 1 - New Volksraad Debates
dei.66.dt코0=West Papua Camps have always been a point of contention, and the tipping point being Starkenborgh Stachouwer expansion of said camps. Though since the signing of the Koninkrijksstatuut, most of these camps have been shut down, though those deemed \"too radical\" still remain in the camps. The Javanese-Malay representatives have demanded that all those in these camps to be released, and furthermore, the camps be shut down completely. Though technically the camps are now under the privy of the New Guinea state, they take their directions from their Dutch representatives.
dei.66.dp코0=\"Forcing Dutch culture on the Insulindian Peoples\" via the Werkverschaffing seems to be the main topic in the Volksraad. The Javanese-Malay representatives state that though the Werkverschaffing has brought prosperity and stability to the working class, its programs, and general structuring is \"Dutch\" in nature. They further advocate that the Werkverschaffing programs are slowing leeching the Javanese-Malay culture, with the more vocal representatives stating that Palar is a prime example of this, and he is merely a lapdog of his Dutch overlords.\n\nThough these representatives clearly have an agenda, they wish to change the Werkverschaffing so each state can implement or change it how they see fit. Though this does not seem to be any cause of alarm, whispers in the halls of the Volksraad have been heard that certain states wish to impose their vision of the Werkverschaffing, which goes against the grain of the entire program.
dei.66.a코0=No they are radicals, they will remain
dei.66.b코0=I mean some can go... I guess.
dei.66.c코0=Fine fine
dei.66.d코0=Each state can run the program how they see fit
dei.66.e코0=This will still be at the degression of our Dutch representatives

dei.67.t코0=Week 2 - New Volksraad Debates
dei.67.d코0=Currently, Dutch is enforced as the Lingua Franca in the Indies, considering that multiple languages are spoken in the Insulands, and thus is considered the official language. However, this measure is not popular among the natives, and thus the Volksraad is debating if Dutch should be enforced as Lingua Franca, or if we should let each state choose if they want to keep it or not.
dei.67.a코0=Each state can choose if they wish to keep it
dei.67.b코0=It remains as the Lingua Franca of the lands.

dei.68.t코0=Week 3 - New Volksraad Debates
dei.68.d코0="During the third week of debate in the Volksraad, the constituent states of the Indies have expressed the wish to merge. Now, this would probably lead to more autonomy to the Indies, but at the same time it would keep the natives happy and reduce the risks of a revolt. What should we do?
dei.68.a코0=Keep them happy and allow it
dei.68.b코0=No, we stick to what we agreed on

dei.69.t코0=Week 4 - New Volksraad Debates
dei.69.d코0=The fourth week of the debate in the Volksraad has lead up to a discussion about the privilege of the Dutch citizens in the Indies. While some radical elements have asked for a complete abolition, perhaps we might slightly reduce them to keep them happy.
dei.69.a코0=Keep them happy and allow it
dei.69.b코0=No, we stick to what we agreed on

dei.70.t코0=Week 5 - New Volksraad Debates
dei.70.d코0=The Queen of the Netherlands, Wilhelmina Elena Pauline Maria of Orange-Nassau, is by extent also the Queen of the Indies. However, she is viewed as an imperialist symbol, although her role is mostly ceremonial, and the natives are asking for her role to be reduced even more. Those requests against the figure of Her Majesty the Queen are outrageous, but we might be forced to compromise to keep the natives happy...
dei.70.a코0=Reduce her role in the states
dei.70.b코0=No, she is all our Queen

dei.71.t코0=Final Countdown
dei.71.d.coop코0=Finally, after weeks of debate, it seems we have been able to appease the natives. Although that means that in the long run, we will probably have to grant the Insulands independence, at least now we can focus on our efforts in improving the economy, and fostering nationalism in those who are loyal to us...
dei.71.d.coup코0=After weeks of debate, it seems we weren't able to strike a deal with the natives. Following this, we have faced increased local unrest across the Insulands, with major protests breaking out in Java and Sumatra, and our police forces are barely enough to manage the situation. Without reinforcements from the Netherlands, this could end up badly...
dei.71.a코0=Finally
dei.71.b코0=BAH!

dei.72.t코0=Counter Proposal
dei.72.d코0=The true plans of these \"debates\" have been laid out before the current administration. The Insulindian-Malay representatives, not happy with the current course of a federal Insulindia, has demanded further centralisation over the autonomous states. This could turn the fledgling nation in a unitary government, which goes completely against the diktat from Amsterdam.
dei.72.a코0=What choice do we have
dei.72.b코0=They wouldn't dare

dei.73.t코0=Proclamation of Insulindian Independence
dei.73.d코0=The final nail in the coffin has been hammered in, with the Insulindian-Malay Representatives within the \"New Volksraad\" unable to come to any compromise with the new administration, deeming an uprising the right course of action. Calls upon all Insulindians to resist the Dutch occupier and to join the Tentara Keselamatan Rakyat, the People's Safety Army. It seems an outright revolt to remove Dutch rule from the Insulindian archipelago has erupted.
dei.73.a코0=Bersiap! (Play Insulindia)
dei.73.b코0=Bereid de Politionele Acties Voor! (Play Dutch East Indies)

dei.74.t코0=Tearing up the Alliance
dei.74.d코0=Brief outline of Socialist-Islamists party. Who wants to do what.
dei.74.a코0=Favour the more level headed socialists
dei.74.b코0=Favour the more conservative Islamist

dei.80.t코0=Peace Deal
dei.80.d코0=#INS controls most of what they can get without foreign aid, and a navy. We should offer a peace deal to the Dutch. We can always get them another day...
dei.80.a코0=Yes, another day...
dei.80.b코0=No, we must strike NOW!

dei.81.t코0=Peace Deal Offered
dei.81.d코0=Our colonial administration in the Insulands is on the brink of collapse, after being defeated militarily in both Sumatra and Java. With our limited resources, there is not much we can do in this situation besides blockading the rebels with our navy, and they seem to know that. They have approached us with a peace offer, and some members in our cabinet are saying we should accept this peace deal before the war becomes a bloodbath. Should we accept this peace deal?
dei.81.a코0=At least we imparted some civilisation on them
dei.81.b코0=They'll never take our fodders

dei.82.t코0=They Refuse
dei.82.d코0=The imperialist Dutch have refused our generous offer for a peace treaty. That means we will just have to end it by kicking out those imperialists out of our sacred land, once for all, without any deal of any sort!
dei.82.a코0=Those imperialist bastards...

dei.83.t코0=Peace Deal Signed
dei.83.d코0=Kemenangan! The Dutch have admitted defeat and have agreed to negotiate peace! After centuries of oppression, we were able to throw off the imperialist yoke, and now the Insulindian people will be able to decide their future for themselves! Hurrah!
dei.83.a코0=Bhinneka Tunggal Ika

dei.84.t코0=Failed Project
dei.84.d코0=The Volksraad of Batavia has been created in 1918 as an attempt to democratize the Insulands, but the failure of the latest congress showed how it’s always been a waste of both time and resources. All we can do is hope that the natives will be more reasonable, next time.
dei.84.a코0=At least we haven't lost our foothold

dei.85.t코0=The First Amendments
dei.85.d코0=The Volksraad of Batavia has been created in 1918 as an attempt to democratize the Insulands, and apparently it’s giving some results: after those 5 weeks of debate, the first effective amendment of the Volksraad of Batavia has been issued its first ever decree, with many more coming up. It seems like the Insulands are becoming democratic people.
dei.85.a코0=At least there is peace
dei.85.b코0=Another crisis avoided

dei.86.t코0=The Future
dei.86.d코0=The Insulands are still a very young nation in a world full of giants. A land with an incredible potential and lots of natural resources, yet undeveloped and extremely poor. /n Now, what shall its future be? A nation closed to the Netherlands, or a master of its own destiny? The future is cloudy, but the proud constituent states that form our great nation have all been through a lot in their history, and they are ready to withstand together everything they will face. No matter how strong our enemies will be, or how many times they will try to defeat us, we will always prevail! Forward, to a brighter future!
dei.86.a코0=The future is yet written

dei_random.2.t코0=Nationalist Holds Rousing Speech!
dei_random.2.d코0=A locally well-known nationalist has held a rousing speech in favour of Insulindian independence, and his call is heeded: many seem to be attracted by the words of this man, and as result the ranks of the underground movement are growing. Local administrators suggest we shut him down, and while such an action would certainly lower the strength of the movement in the short term, it could result in greater unity for the movement in the long term.
dei_random.2.a코0=Arrest him for rabblerousing!
dei_random.2.b코0=Let him talk...

dei_random.3.t코0=Infiltration of a Nationalist Group
dei_random.3.d코0=One of the agents of our colonial security service, the PID, has managed to infiltrate a group advocating for Insulindian independence. We can use this asset to either sabotage their efforts, or to try to sow discord among their ranks which could impact collaboration with other groups across the land. What shall we instruct our agent to do?
dei_random.3.a코0=Sow Discord!
dei_random.3.b코0=Sabotage their arms!

dei_random.4.t코0=Nationalists Fight Each Other!
dei_random.4.d코0=The fact that the nationalists and the syndicalists didn't really like each other was clear before, but now guerrillas of both sides have started fighting each other in the countryside. The KNIL stands ready to intervene, but some people say it would perhaps be better to let them weaken each other while we sit back and relax, as that will both thin out their numbers and make them less likely to reconcile.
dei_random.4.a코0=Intervene immediately.
dei_random.4.b코0=Bets are on! Who will win?

dei_random.5.t코0=Regent Murdered
dei_random.5.d코0=One of our local administrators, known as 'regents' has been murdered. The police suspect it is a gang of pro-nationalist thugs who were angered by recent statements of the regent who are known for their terror. They don not have the means to prove this as of yet though, will we allow them to just bring them in, as it seems highly unlikely that it is not them? Or do we prefer to spend time and money investigating the case in detail?
dei_random.5.a코0=Just pick them up...
dei_random.5.b코0=An investigation is preferable.

dei_random.6.t코0=Nationalist Leader Arrested
dei_random.6.d코0=Police have managed to take in a prominent figure in nationalist circles following an in-depth operation, and this high-profile arrest will certainly limit the strength of the independence movement in the near future. While charges to be pressed against him are clear, some people in the colonial government warn against bringing him to court, as it could give him a loudspeaker to spread his dangerous ideas when the papers report on it.
dei_random.6.a코0=He would get convicted anyways, why bother?!
dei_random.6.b코0=Every man deserves a process!

dei_random.7.t코0=RSAP Representative Calls for Independence
dei_random.7.d코0=A socialist member of the (metropolitan) Dutch House of Representatives has openly called for the end of Dutch rule in Insulindia, and unsurprisingly the news entered the indies within hours. Many nationalists feel emboldened by this sign of growing support for the Insulindian cause in the mainland Netherlands, and they will likely win new members in this move too. A letter thanking the 'good belanda' has already been circulating in Batavia.
dei_random.7.a코0=I would hardly call a syndicalist Dutch.

dei_random.8.t코0=Indo Speaks against Independence
dei_random.8.d코0=A senior member of our Indo-Dutch (mixed race of European and Insulindian descent) has spoken out against independence, arguing it would subject the Indo people to an unfair tyranny of an Inlander majority. His call has even reached the metropolitan Netherlands where it seems to influence the public opinion against independence (although this was arguably the case already). Nevertheless, the Ministry of Colonies might be more eager to send support.
dei_random.8.a코0=Give me the Minister please, we need support!

dei_random.9.t코0=Nationalist Riot
dei_random.9.d코0=Nationalists have taken to the streets, but what was supposed to be a peaceful demonstration quickly turned violent as our police wanted to disperse them. We don't know if the violence will expand, and the chief of police wonders how we want him to respond to this event...
dei_random.9.a코0=Crack down hard on these thugs!
dei_random.9.b코0=Disperse them but keep violence to a minimum.
dei_random.9.c코0=Whatever happens, don't shoot!

dei_random.10.t코0=Dutch Couple Lynched in Bali
dei_random.10.d코0=A Dutch Couple that was in Bali for business purposes has been lynched by a furious crowd; the couple went to a temple where monkeys lived that are considered holy by the local populace. Once there, one of the monkeys proceeded to sit on the miss, pulling her hair, and prompting the husband to scare it away with a big stick, infuriating the locals. The two failed to escape and were lynched publicly... The homeland is furious about this event and demands justice!
dei_random.10.a코0=Arrest every last person in that mob!
dei_random.10.b코0=Just let it slide.

dei_random.11.t코0=KNIL Detachment Ambushed
dei_random.11.d코0=A KNIL detachment has been ambushed by a pro-independence guerrilla force, leaving few survivors in its wake. Our military advisers are urging us to outfit a punitive expedition, while the loyalist newspapers are pointing out how much the strength of the pro-independence groups have grown lately that they are able to mount such an attack successfully.\nCaution is advised however, as if the punitive expedition gets tricked as well, it will only exacerbate the situation.
dei_random.11.a코0=A very sad incident indeed.
dei_random.11.b코0=Outfit that punitive expedition!

dei_random_followup.1.t코0=Regent Murdered - Group Implicated
dei_random_followup.1.d코0=Following an in-depth investigation, the police concluded to have sufficient evidence to take in the group. It was indeed this nationalist group, and now the people who said so from the beginning are ridiculing us for setting up this investigation.
dei_random_followup.1.a코0=But at least it's proven now!

dei_random_followup.2.t코0=Regent murdered - Serial Killer Arrested
dei_random_followup.2.d코0=Following an in-depth investigation, the police concluded that it was in fact not this nationalistic group, but a serial killer who seems to have killed other people as well of lesser importance. It's probably for the better that we investigated this case properly, or we might have arrested innocents.
dei_random_followup.2.a코0=Good!

dei_random_followup.3.t코0=Regent Murdered - Dead End Reached
dei_random_followup.3.d코0=Following an in-depth investigation, the police concluded that there is insufficient evidence to press charges against anyone. The number of clues appear to be too little for them to solve the mystery.
dei_random_followup.3.a코0=Arrest these people you've said must've been it!
dei_random_followup.3.b코0=That means we can't arrest anyone.

dei_random_followup.4.t코0=Nationalist Leader Arrested - Rousing Speech
dei_random_followup.4.d코0=The nationalist took on his own defence and used it to give a rousing speech for the cause of Insulindian independence. While our censorship laws managed to stop the regular press from publishing this shameless propaganda for chaos, it already slipped through the cracks, and transcripts of it are already being spread throughout the city.
dei_random_followup.4.a코0=I told you bringing him to court was a bad idea?!

dei_random_followup.5.t코0=Nationalist Leader Arrested - Failing Defence
dei_random_followup.5.d코0=The nationalist took on his own defence, but his performance was so pathetic even his staunchest allies must give that the speech alone probably made him deserve to be put away. Of course the papers reported on full on this and the nationalists have just lost a major propaganda battle.
dei_random_followup.5.a코0=Hehe...

dei_random_followup.6.t코0=Punitive Expedition Successful!
dei_random_followup.6.d코0=The punitive expedition we outfitted as retribution for the guerrilla attack on our forces a few weeks ago has returned, having fulfilled its mission. They discovered and raided the guerrilla forces' camp, setting their efforts back significantly and retrieving the weapons they stole from us. It has been the right choice to do this.
dei_random_followup.6.a코0=Great.

dei_random_followup.7.t코0=Punitive Expedition Butchered!
dei_random_followup.7.d코0=The punitive expedition we outfitted as retribution for the guerrilla attack has been slaughtered in turn.
dei_random_followup.7.a코0=Oh Lord...

dei_flavor.1.t코0=Antara Founded
dei_flavor.1.d코0=20 years ago, in 1917, the Aneta, the General New and Telegraph Agency was founded by Dominique Berretty, being the first news outlet in the Indies and thus growing to become the primary news outlet in the Indies. Today, a group of Insulindian nationalists, dissatisfied with the lack of coverage of local news, have launched their own news agency, by the name of Antara. Many in the colonial government fear this organisation will support the general independence movement in their struggle.
dei_flavor.1.a코0=It's just healthy competition.
dei_flavor.1.b코0=Shut this propaganda platform down!

dei_flavor.2.t코0=Renovate the Concordia Society Building?
dei_flavor.2.d코0=The 'Sociëteit Concordia' building in Bandoeng was originally built as a place for the inhabitants of Bandoeng to come together in 1895, built in neoclassicist style. While we've already rebuilt the building in 1926, in Art-Deco style at that, we are currently seeing that it's once more losing its grace. The local government of Bandoeng is requesting us permission to allow architect Albert Aalbers to lead the renovation.
dei_flavor.2.a코0=Of course!
dei_flavor.2.b코0=Too expensive!

dei_flavor.3.t코0=Foundation of the NIVU
dei_flavor.3.d코0=The NIVU (Nederlands-Indische Voetbal Unie - Dutch East Indian Football Union) has been founded today as the official organisation concerning organised football in the Dutch East Indies. Previously, the Dutch East Indies government worked directly with the native PSSI, but since the sport has grown in popularity it is important that a fair amount of Totoks and Chinese will take part in the colonial team, something the new NIVU will make sure, as well as creating a more secure environment for it.
dei_flavor.3.a코0=Rejoice!

dei_flavor.4.t코0=Premiere of Terang Boelan
dei_flavor.4.d코0=The Insulindian-Malay language film Terang Boelan (Full Moon) has seen its first public display last week and already seems to become a commercial success.\nThe film features two lovers, Kasim and Rohaya who have to separate due to the bride's father's choice of another man, Musa. The two decide to elope to Malakka, where they find an old friend, whose name is Dullah. Kasim and Rohaya live there until Musa, who turns out to be an opium dealer, discovers their location and has Rohaya brought back to their home village. Kasim follows them and starts a fight against Musa, after which he is saved by Dullah, so the two can marry.\nThe film seems to have brought new life to a film industry that was on a downturn for several years as a result of Babelsberg films entering the East Indian market, with its popularity even crossing the Malacca strait into German Malaya.
dei_flavor.4.a코0=Interesting!

dei_flavor.5.t코0=Launch of Cultureel Indië
dei_flavor.5.d코0=The first edition of the 'Cultureel Indië' weekmagazine has been released this week. The paper, made by the editorial staff of the ethnological department of the East Indian Institute in Amsterdam, harbours articles about the culture and daily life in the Dutch East Indies. The first edition is a resounding success and will aid us well in making people in the homeland familiar with their country's jewel of the empire.
dei_flavor.5.a코0=Definitely a commendable initiative!

dei_flavor.6.t코0=The Carstensz Expedition
dei_flavor.6.d코0=Three brave explorers, Anton Colijn, Jean Jacques Dozy and Frits Wissel have left the city of Aika today to undertake an expedition hoping to reach the peak of the highest mountain of the Carstensz mountain range in Dutch New Guinea, which many other explorers tried to reach to no avail around the turn of the century. It remains to be seen whether the feat will be accomplished this time.
dei_flavor.6.a코0=The best of luck!

dei_flavor.7.t코0=The Carstensz Expedition Returns!
dei_flavor.7.d코0=The Carstensz Expedition, who were intent on scaling the highest mountain in the Carstensz mountain range, the Ngga Pulu, have successfully returned to civilisation, having succeeded in their goal.\nWhat's more, Cozy, one of the three explorers, has discovered a large gold-deposit in the wilderness, which could be most advantageous if we could mine it. Sadly the area is so inhospitable it will take years, if not decades for us to take advantage of this.
dei_flavor.7.a코0=A toast to our heros!

dei_flavor.8.t코0=The Carstensz Expedition Returns!
dei_flavor.8.d코0=The Carstensz Expedition has returned, but have been unable to attain their goal of scaling the highest peak of the mountain range, the Ngga Pulu.\nThey do report however that Cozy, who is a geologist, found an ore mountain filled with a large deposit of gold ore. The state of the land however is so unhospitable that it will take years if not decades for us to clear it out for exploitation.
dei_flavor.8.a코0=Welcome back in civilisation!

dei_flavor.9.t코0=Where is the Carstensz Expedition?
dei_flavor.9.d코0=Ever since their leaving of the city of Aika, nothing has been heard back from the Carstensz expedition in New Guinea, who were seeking to scale the Ngga Pulu peak.\nConsidering the time that has passed since then, we can only assume they succumbed to the wilderness, fell prey to hostile tribes or animals or to nature itself.
dei_flavor.9.a코0=Requiescat in Pace!

dei_flavor.10.t코0=Derby Dutch East Indies-Hungary
dei_flavor.10.d코0=The Dutch East Indian colonial team has successfully managed to qualify itself to the world championship of 1938 in Brazil (being the first time when they managed to do so), and just recently arrived there. Now it is time to play the first game against the team of Hungary. Sadly, we were completely slaughtered by the Hungarian team, who reigned victorious with 6 goals to our 0, kicking us immediately out of the competition.
dei_flavor.10.a코0=... well, at least it was an honour to be there!

dei_flavor.11.t코0=Return of the Mimika Expedition
dei_flavor.11.d코0=Having departed the 15th of October last year, the Mimika expedition has finally returned to the civilised world. The expedition intended to make further contact with the Tapiro people in the New Guinea rainforest, who had been discovered in 1910 by the British ornithological expedition. Although no new tribes have been discovered, the expedition did visit a Tapiro settlement that was not yet visited before, allowing them to study these people with merely stone-age technology. Later they also visited the people living in the Pania mountain range, resulting after a steep climb in the discovery of several settlements in one of the range's river valleys, resulting in the stunning discovery that despite the limited length of these 'mountain papuans', they could not be considered a pygmy people. The expedition was a resounding success; this is a great day for anthropology!
dei_flavor.11.a코0=Fascinating discoveries indeed!

holex.1.t코0=The Formation of the Government in Exile
holex.1.d코0=When the socialists stormed her residence, her majesty was nowhere to be seen. Now it becomes clear where she was: on a warship off the coast, primarily on the insistence of her close confidents, who argued that the fight against the syndicalist menace ought to be continued from overseas; she called every faithful Dutch loyalist to join her, and where this is impossible, to resist the syndicalist menace with all their strength: the Dutch government in exile is risen, a phoenix of conservative hope!
holex.1.a코0=Side with the Batavian Commune.
holex.1.b코0=Side with the Homeland.

holex.2.t코0=The Location of Our Government-in-exile
holex.2.d코0=It is clear that the Dutch government in exile would be an easy target for the evermore aggressive Japanese empire in Asia, as well as its neighbours in the western possessions. Besides, how are we supposed to re-establish control over the homeland if we have no allies to do so? It was clear that the government in exile would have to be set up with a friendly government. There are two choices for the queen: contact Canada and join the other exiles of Europe, who also lack a solid foothold in Europe but will be capable of protecting themselves, or the German empire, who can likely easily destroy the Batavian Commune (in a few years or maybe even immediately) but who will likely dominate us to the point of us being reduced to a mere puppet if they help us restore rightful order to the homeland.
holex.2.a코0=Our government in exile belongs in Ottawa!
holex.2.b코0=To Berlin!
holex.2.c코0=To Batavia, we need no allies!

holex.3.t코0=[DEI.GetNameDefCap] Wants to Settle Their Government Here
holex.3.d코0=One more monarchy has fallen to the stain of syndicalism, but their queen and her confidents escaped the chaos to establish a resistance from the colonies, that remained loyal to her. She requests to enter in an alliance with us and to establish a government in exile in our capital.
holex.3.a코0=Of course!
holex.3.b코0=I don't think so...

holex.4.t코0=Acceptance from [From.GetNameDef]
holex.4.d코0=A letter from [From.GetNameDef] accepted our request and allowed us to set up our government in exile in their capital, as well as agreeing to enter in an alliance against the syndicalist menace that holds our country in her sway.
holex.4.a코0=Good to hear!

holex.5.t코0=Rejection from [From.GetNameDef]
holex.5.d코0=A letter from [From.GetNameDef] claims that our 'civil war' is a strictly internal Dutch affair and that [From.GetNameDef] is unable to support us in our struggle.
holex.5.a코0=Only one option left, then...
holex.5.b코0=We will have to take the syndicalists on ourselves then...

holex.6.t코0=Reports of [CAF.GetNameDef] Occupying Our American Possessions
holex.6.d코0=[CAF.GetAdjective] forces have violated our sovereignty and moved into Surinam and our other possessions in the western hemisphere without our permission, allegedly to 'secure continuous stability' that our government, according to them, could not ensure. This is an outrageous insult to our integrity!
holex.6.a코0=We will not forget this!

holex.7.t코0=The Dutch Are in Chaos!
holex.7.d코0=The Dutch government has been thrown into chaos on account of a socialist revolution in their metropole, and from our perspective, this seems to be the ideal moment to seize their colonies off the [VEN.GetAdjective] coast, areas that from the start were supposed to be [VEN.GetAdjective], as the Dutch are unable to strike back!
holex.7.a코0=Send the warships!
holex.7.b코0=We can't risk it...

holex.8.t코0=Venezuela Invades Curacao
holex.8.d코0=Recognizing our moment of weakness, the Venezuelan government decided to strike and occupy Curacao, which Venezuela has claimed as theirs for a long time already, as we can't fight back against it. While some military experts in the queen's entourage want to outfit an immediate action against this illegal act to free Curacao, it is clear that we are as of currently unable to do so.
holex.8.a코0=The sad truth...

holex.9.t코0=The Cabinet in Exile
holex.9.d코0=With the homeland fallen, the usual constitutional checks on the queen's power could not be exercised due to the lack of parliament. In effect this means that royal decrees are the only legal laws by the government, but neither can they be blocked without a parliament. All power, no matter how the political situation was laid up back at home, now rests with the queen, who is now set to appoint the first exiled Dutch cabinet; will she solidify her rule by creating a loyal cabinet or will she instead form an ARP-cabinet, her all-time favourite?
holex.9.a코0=The queen establishes direct rule.
holex.9.b코0=Experienced Statesman Colijn is appointed prime minister.
holex.9.c코0=Militant politician Gerbrandy is appointed prime minister.

holex.10.t코0=Bargain of Batavia
holex.10.d코0=As the first batch of exiles has arrived in Batavia, it has become clear that the situation will soon become unmanageable unless we give the East Indians a significant concession. They want independence, and while they obviously are not ready for it yet, we do need them to retake the fatherland. Some suggest they might perhaps be swayed by a promise of equal status within the kingdom. The queen will give a speech today, and many Insulindians anxiously await what she has to say, hoping for a promise of significant improvement.
holex.10.a코0=When the Netherlands regain their freedom, so will Insulindia...
holex.10.b코0=Equal status for the East Indies is in the charts...
holex.10.c코0=We don't give in to Inlanders!

holex.11.t코0=Resistance Raids Factory
holex.11.d코0=A reactionary resistance cell launched a raid on one of our production facilities. Sadly, they managed to do quite a good job, significantly hurting our production capacity there as well as a successful evacuation, leaving us unable to trace them.

holex.12.t코0=Operation Successful!
holex.12.d코0=Our boots on the ground report that the operation to sabotage our designated production target went flawless: all 25 resistance members managed to evacuate safely, after successfully destroying the facility.

holex.13.t코0=Resistance Raids Factory
holex.13.d코0=A reactionary resistance cell launched a raid on one of our production facilities. Although they managed to do quite a good job, significantly hurting our production capacity there, we managed to kill 4 of them and we took an additional 2 into custody. They are being interrogated as we speak.
holex.13.a코0=Blasted Reactionaries!

holex.14.t코0=Operation Semi-successful!
holex.14.d코0=Our boots on the ground report that the operation to sabotage our designated production target was successful, however 6 resistance members failed to evacuate safely after successfully sabotaging the facility, we think 4 of those have been killed in the firefight that ensued with the authorities and 2 were arrested alive. Assuming no one will hold under torture, we are forced to put the rest of the team into hiding as they knew each other.
holex.14.a코0=Good, but bad...

holex.15.t코0=Resistance Raids Factory
holex.15.d코0=A reactionary resistance cell tried to launch a raid on one of our production facilities. Before they reached it however, they hit onto a patrol which caused a firefight to erupt. After the patrol called in reinforcements the reactionaries retreated, with our side having killed 7 of these thugs. We also took one of them, who was wounded and thus incapacitated, into custody, but he died on the way to the hospital before we could interrogate him.
holex.15.a코0=Blasted reactionaries!

holex.16.t코0=Operation Failed!
holex.16.d코0=Our boots on the ground report that the operation to sabotage our designated production target was a failure, the resistance group hit on a patrol on the way to sabotage the facility, 7 of our men have been killed in the ensuing firefight and one became missing in action when he was wounded and collapsed on the ground; we can only assume he was taken in by the authorities. Assuming no one will hold under torture, we are forced to put the rest of the team into hiding as he knew the others.
holex.16.a코0=This is a disaster!

holex.17.t코0=Resistance Falls for Trap
holex.17.d코0=A reactionary resistance cell tried to launch a raid on one of our production facilities, exactly as our informant wanted. They went in their right into our trap, causing a firefight in which we killed several of their party, and arrested the rest, including the leader, who might well know people beyond just his little group.
holex.17.a코0=Tell us more, or we'll shoot your toe off!

holex.18.t코0=Operation Failed!
holex.18.d코0=Our boots on the ground report that none of the operatives deployed in the field to sabotage the production facility have returned. Upon sending a scout he soon reported back that the factory remained intact, but that the police was all over. Evidently it had been a trap. What's worse, for all we know the leader of the group may have been arrested too, so we'll have to take all thirty operatives he had contact within the resistance into hiding as a safeguard.
holex.18.a코0=This is more than a disaster!

holex.19.t코0=Operation Failed!
holex.19.d코0=Our boots on the ground report that the operatives in the field aborted the operation before it even started, after one of the men saw one of the labourers who stayed late wield a gun. The leader then decided that the safety of the group was more important than the mission and ordered the group to turn back...
holex.19.a코0=It was likely the best choice.

holex.20.t코0=Resistance Raids Factory
holex.20.d코0=A reactionary resistance cell launched a raid on one of our arms factories. Sadly, they managed to do quite a good job, significantly hurting our production capabilities there as well as pulling off a successful evacuation, leaving us unable to trace them.
holex.20.a코0=Blasted reactionaries!

holex.21.t코0=Operation Successful!
holex.21.d코0=Our boots on the ground report that the operation to sabotage our designated arms factory went flawless: all 25 resistance members managed to evacuate safely, after successfully destroying the facility.

holex.22.d코0=A reactionary resistance cell launched a raid on one of our arms factories.

holex.23.t코0=Operation Semi-successful!
holex.23.d코0=Our boots on the ground report that the operation to sabotage the designated arms factory was successful, however 6 resistance members failed to evacuate safely after successfully sabotaging the facility, we suspect 4 of those have been killed in the firefight that ensued with the authorities and 2 were arrested alive. Assuming no one will hold under torture, we are forced to put the rest of the team into hiding as they knew each other.
holex.23.a코0=Good, but bad...

holex.24.t코0=Resistance Raids Factory
holex.24.d코0=A reactionary resistance cell tried to launch a raid on one of our arms factories. Before they reached it however, they hit onto a patrol which caused a firefight to erupt. After the patrol called in reinforcements the reactionaries retreated, with our side having killed 12 of these thugs. We also took one of them, who was wounded and thus incapacitated, into custody, he is being interrogated in the hospital at this very moment.
holex.24.a코0=Blasted reactionaries!

holex.25.t코0=Operation Failed!
holex.25.d코0=Our boots on the ground report that the operation to sabotage our designated production target was a failure, the resistance group hit on a patrol on the way to sabotage the facility, twelve of our men have been killed in the ensuing firefight and two became missing in action when they were wounded and collapsed during the evac; we can only assume they were taken in by the authorities. Assuming no one will hold under torture, we are forced to put the rest of the team into hiding as they knew the others.
holex.25.a코0=This is a disaster!

holex.26.t코0=Resistance Falls for Trap
holex.26.d코0=A reactionary resistance cell tried to launch a raid on one of our arms factories, exactly as our informant wanted. They went in their right into our trap, causing a firefight in which we killed several of their party, and arrested the rest, including the leader, who might well know people beyond just his little group.

The leader then decided that the safety of the group was more important than the mission and ordered the group to turn back...
holex.28.a코0=It was likely the best choice.

holex.29.t코0=Resistance Bombs a Railway!
holex.29.d코0=A small group of reactionary terrorists have bombed a railway line in the deepest of the night. Sadly, no trace of them is to be found and there's little we can do besides repairing the damage.
holex.29.a코0=Petty Terrorists!

holex.30.t코0=Successful Operation!
holex.30.d코0=Our operatives report success in bombing the designated railway. The[HolexSyndicalistOrGerman] will not know what hit them and the whole group has safely returned!
holex.30.a코0=Good, good!

holex.31.t코0=Resistance Members Arrested!
holex.31.d코0=A small group of reactionary terrorists tried to bomb a railwayline in the deepest of the night, but they were discovered by a local and were swiftly taken into custody. The streets are a bit safer again now.
holex.31.a코0=Good riddance!

holex.32.t코0=Failed Operation!
holex.32.d코0=Our operatives had evidently been spotted on the way to their target, for the police suddenly appeared and arrested all five of them, according to a local sympathetic to our cause. We need to work quickly to put their contact persons into hiding.
holex.32.a코0=Quick, inform them!

holex.33.t코0=Police Raid Hits Resistance Network
holex.33.d코0=The reactionary resistance network operated by [DEI.GetNameDef] has been hit by a police raid, which was a grandiose success: eight reactionaries have been taken in and we extracted knowledge about other members' whereabouts from them, although the resistance probably has told them to go into hiding by now. This is a big win for our rule!
holex.33.a코0=Good riddance!

holex.34.t코0=Police Raid Hits Resistance Network
holex.34.d코0=Our network was hit by a police raid, evidently directed by someone who knew a lot about the nature of our network. All 8 targets of theirs have been hauled off by policemen, and since they have contact persons whom they know, we'll have to take them into hiding as a safeguard.
holex.34.a코0=Oh no!

holex.35.t코0=Police Raid Hits Resistance Network
holex.35.d코0=The reactionary resistance network operated by [DEI.GetNameDef] has been hit by a police raid, which was moderately successful: we arrested 4 reactionaries, meaning 4 others also were allowed to mistake, but at least we managed to extract intelligence about some other members so we're forcing a fair amount of resistance operatives to lay low.
holex.35.a코0=At least that's something...

holex.36.t코0=Police Raid Hits Resistance Network
holex.36.d코0=Our network was hit by a police raid, evidently directed by someone who knew a lot about the nature of our network. They targeted 8 members, 4 of whom managed to evacuate. The 4 that were actually arrested had other contacts, and evidently they know who the other 4 are, so it seems we have no choice but to take both these groups into hiding.
holex.36.a코0=Oh no!

holex.37.t코0=Police Raid Hits Resistance Network
holex.37.d코0=The reactionary resistance network operated by [DEI.GetNameDef] has been hit by a police raid, which was an absolute disgrace to our police apparatus: all 8 targets escaped. The only bright point is that the resistance, knowing that we identified their operatives, is forced to put them into hiding which makes them unable to execute any missions for a while.
holex.37.a코0=Blast!

holex.38.t코0=Police Raid Hits Resistance Network
holex.38.d코0=The police tried to raid our network today, attempting to take in 8 designated targets who were clearly turned in by someone. Luckily however, all 8 managed to escape, though evidently the authorities know of their identity and thus they'll be forced into hiding.
holex.38.a코0=Nice try...

holex.39.t코0=Revolution in the Netherlands
holex.39.d코0=Disturbing news from the Netherlands has arrived; apparently syndicalist elements have overthrown the legitimate democratic government and imposed tyranny on the metropolitan Netherlands. The queen and several loyalists successfully evacuated and seem to intend to start a government in exile here.
holex.39.a코0=Of course, welcome!

holex.40.t코0=Birthright Restored!
holex.40.d코0=We have successfully liberated the Netherlands and re-established its rightful order. Obviously, a strong government will have to be instituted there before we can re-establish elections lest syndicalism return, but the worst is over. The question is how to move forward, including the fate of the colonies, and specifically the Dutch East Indies, who fought so hard for the liberation of the homeland.
holex.40.a코0=Independence is granted, as promised (Play as the Netherlands)
holex.40.b코0=Independence is granted, as promised (Play as Insulindia)
holex.40.c코0=The Indies get equal status, as promised.
holex.40.e코0=The old order will be re-established (Play as the colonial government)
holex.40.f코0=The old order will be re-established (Play as the Netherlands)

holex.41.t코0=[From.GetNameDefCap] Betrayed Us
holex.41.d코0=The despicable [From.GetAdjective] menace decided to deny us our homeland after they managed to seize control over it from the menace that was, in spite of the alliance our countries were in. It seems we stand alone once more.
holex.41.a코0=[From.GetNameDefCap] will pay for this!

DEI_bypass_singapur_desc코0=In recent years, more and more goods directed toward Mitteleuropa are shipped through Singapur rather than Batavia, but we control our side of the strait of Malacca as well, we owe nothing in these taxes to Germany and can easily resupply in our own ports.

DEI_selfsustaining_foodsystem코0=A Self-sustainable Foodsystem

Looking up, a fellow soldier of Papuan descent, reached his arm out, and aided Dylan saying in terrible Dutch \"What's wrong Dylan,they got you pushing too many pencils?\"
DEI_Overvalwagen코0=Overvalwagen Procurements
DEI_Overvalwagen_desc코0=The Overvalwagens, are lightly armoured Chevrolet trucks designed by Captain R.J. Luijke Roskott, who is an Engineer within the Dutch Army.

DEI_vnh_12코0=Attract Like Minded Europeans
DEI_vnh_12_desc코0=Our cause is just; our methods are sound. With this in mind, we must seek those fellow Europeans, who are liked minded, and willing to embrace our proud culture.

DEI_vnh_13_desc코0=Our South African Afrikaner friends within the South African nationalist party have shown a keen interest in the work of the VNH, with several dubbed \"Boer Kommandos\" eagerly offering their services to better train our forces in asymmetric warfare.
DEI_vnh_14코0=Reforms Complete
DEI_vnh_14_desc코0=The KNIL has now been reformed as the protector of Dutch culture within the East Indies. And also, to provide more than a rudimentary defence against any would be attacker. Though the locals are restless, with more and more police actions occurring.

DEI_con_2코0=Recon Elements

DEI_con_3코0=Standardised Training Routines

DEI_con_7_desc코0=Our cadets have returned form the King's Military Academy in the Netherlands, bringing with them the latest in military theorem.

DEI_con_10코0=NCO Training
DEI_con_10_desc코0=Most Inlanders have a rudimentary control of the Dutch language. Overtime, there are hopes that this will not be a problem. Till then, all NCOs, regardless of background are to act as an intermediary between the generally Dutch speaker Officers, and the generally Inlander speaking rank and file.
DEI_con_11코0=Expand the Auxiliaries
DEI_con_11_desc코0=The Auxiliaries serve as a loyal militia and are usually stationed within the outskirts of the colony. In an effect to gain greater control of the archipelago, the KNIL is expanding the Auxiliaries, and the capabilities, in an effort to maintain control.

DEI_con_12_desc코0=The reforms, which have been mainly on the top level of KNIL, are now beginning to flow down upon the rank and file.

DEI_con_14코0=Reforms Complete
DEI_con_14_desc코0=The light at the end of the tunnel has grown brighter, and brighter. Though these reforms have not turned the KNIL into a professional standing Army, they have uplifted the KNIL from a Police Force, to a well-equipped Home Guard.
DEI_white_phosphorus코0=Witte Fosfor Brandbommen
DEI_white_phosphorus_desc코0=White Phosphorous incendiary bombs appear to have been procured by unknown means to be used by the KNIL Air Corps. These incendiary weapons appear to be highly effective against enemies seek cover amongst the dense jungle environs that the Dutch East Indies provides.
DEI_night_figthing코0=Night Fighting
DEI_night_figthing_desc코0=The KNIL Air Corps will never have the best fighters or equipment, but the use of unconventional tactics via the cover of darkness shall give us the edge we need.

DEI_army_of_all_east_indians코0=Army of all East Indians
DEI_army_of_all_east_indians_desc코0=So far, we've not accepted any Inlanders in meaningful numbers into our ranks, but the archipelago is large, and the threats to it many, and our 'white' KNIL is overstretched. Perhaps we should consider changing this policy.
DEI_selfsufficient_defense코0=Self-sufficient Defence Force
DEI_selfsufficient_defense_desc코0=By taking in locals who are willing to work with us, our defence can become self-sufficient, with no risk of us becoming vulnerable in the unfortunate event that, for instance, the mainland Netherlands would be occupied by a foreign power.
DEI_small_but_trained코0=Army of Totoks
DEI_small_but_trained_desc코0=Letting in Inlanders in our ranks would only degrade our superior morale and proud tradition. The KNIL has held its ground for long enough and with extensive conscription amongst the Europeans in the colony, we can surely keep the colony safe until reinforcements shall arrive.
DEI_planning_for_emergency코0=Planning for an Emergency
DEI_planning_for_emergency_desc코0=If there is an emergency, we may not be able to keep the situation in check forever, but we can surely stall any invasion long enough for conscripted reinforcement from the homeland to arrive.
DEI_doctrine_for_the_army코0=Doctrinal Effort
DEI_doctrine_for_the_army_desc코0=We should pick a doctrine to follow, lest we lag behind compared to those wishing to see us harm in doctrinal matters.
DEI_jungle_training코0=Jungle Training
DEI_jungle_training_desc코0=Much of the Dutch East Indies is made up of jungle. We should focus on training in these harsh conditions, to allow us to fight more efficiently in those conditions.

DEI_fortifying_java코0=Fortifying Java

DEI_military_aviation_of_the_KNIL코0=Military Aviation of the KNIL
DEI_military_aviation_of_the_KNIL_desc코0=The Military Aviation of the KNIL acts as the air force of the colony. While we currently have a few planes already, it seems the war of the future shall be fought in the air, and we cannot allow our enemies to take the upper hand there.
DEI_purchase_old_fokker_fighters코0=Request Extra Investments
DEI_purchase_old_fokker_fighters_desc코0=By requesting the government to do extra investments in our local air force, we can both maintain and expand this military branch to become competitive with the rest of the world.

DEI_east_indian_fighters코0=East Indian Fighters
DEI_east_indian_fighters_desc코0=Bombers can do nothing if enemy fighters pull them out the air; we should invest in fighters to ensure the security of our airspace and to prevent enemy bombers from operating above our lands.
DEI_expand_airfields코0=Expand the Airfields
DEI_expand_airfields_desc코0=The Indies are far and wide. By expanding the airfields, we cannot only serve a military purpose, but also increase the capacity of civilian airfields allowed goods, people and information to travel faster between the islands.
DEI_fokker_investments코0=Fokker Investments
DEI_fokker_investments_desc코0=Fokker is Europe's largest plane producer and has strong ties to the Netherlands. By granting them advantages in regulation or tax we might be able to tempt them into investing here, perhaps as their first time branching out to Asia.
DEI_expand_the_government_navy코0=Expand the Government Navy
DEI_expand_the_government_navy_desc코0=The Government Navy is officially not part of the KNIL, therefore we lack any jurisdiction over it, but its location here does make us the de-facto overseeing instance. We should invest in expanding it, right here!
DEI_local_dockyards코0=Local Dockyards
DEI_local_dockyards_desc코0=By producing dockyards right here, we can build some ships separate from the Netherlands, allowing us a bit more freedom to produce new ships within our budget.
DEI_submarine_focus코0=Focus on Submarines
DEI_submarine_focus_desc코0=In an open battle against the Japanese, it seems impossible to beat their navy. Instead, we should focus on our own advantages: the Netherlands maintains some of the most sophisticated submarines, an unique advantage that could win us an advantage in the naval battle.
DEI_royal_naval_bombers코0=Naval Bombers
DEI_royal_naval_bombers_desc코0=Naval bombers have never been a top priority for the KNIL Air Corps, or the Dutch Navy contingent stationed within the Dutch East Indies. However, our naval bomber designs should be reviewed - even if procurement of anything more than a licence may be highly unlikely.
DEI_naval_guerilla코0=Helfrich's Naval Guerrilla  Plan
DEI_naval_guerilla_desc코0=Admiral Helfrich has devised a 'guerrilla' plan, using submarines to attack and then disengage, to wear out any enemy naval superiority as if it were a guerrilla war on land. Only the Dutch would think this is a viable turn of phase...
DEI_light_cruiser_focus코0=Focus on Light Cruisers
DEI_light_cruiser_focus_desc코0=We should focus on light cruisers as strong ships that can safeguard our larger capital ships while still maintaining enough firepower to deter our enemies.
DEI_destroyer_focus코0=Focus on Destroyers
DEI_destroyer_focus_desc코0=Destroyers are ideal to fight off enemy submarines and thus as screening vessels. Investing in them might be a sound idea.
DEI_naval_direction코0=Review of the Nederlands-Indische Vloot
DEI_naval_direction_desc코0=A top to bottom review of the current state of the Royal Dutch Navy fleet station in the Dutch East Indies is to occur, with even the most positive outcome looking grim.
DEI_vlootplan_helfrich코0=Admiral Helfrich Vlootplan
DEI_vlootplan_helfrich_desc코0=Much alike to his proposed plan for the Dutch Navy (be it popular or not), Admiral Helrich proposes the use of submarines to harry the enemy, and strike at their supply lines. This is both practicable, and affordable, also allowing for these new submarines to be constructed locally.
DEI_naval_company코0=Koninklijke Rotterdamsche Lloyd
DEI_naval_company_desc코0=Founded in 1875, as a mail-ship service between the Netherlands, and the Dutch East Indies, has become one of the sole shipbuilding companies within the archipelago.

DEI_destroyer_duties_desc코0=Admiral Helfrich's approach of \"evil knows evil\" regarding submarine warfare would have smaller detachments aggressively patrolling threats to shipping opposed to waiting for them to strike.
DEI_New_Tactics_For_New_Ships코0=New Naval Tactics
DEI_New_Tactics_For_New_Ships_desc코0=Admiral Helfrich reforms have trickled down throughout the ranks, though many are concerned his more \"aggressive\" nature of naval warfare, could lead to less rational thinking.

DEI_de_jonge_resigns_desc코0=Governor-General De Jonge has held office now since 1931 and had announced in advance that he would retire from it for a while. Time to invite our new governor-general to the palace in Batavia.
DEI_nico_palar코0=Palar's Reform
DEI_nico_palar_desc코0=Nico Palar is a senior member of the SDAP party and would be the first native governor-general of the colonies. We're honoured to welcome him back to his homeland after he worked in the Netherlands for a while.
DEI_fund_the_ethical_policy코0=Fund the Ethische Politiek
DEI_fund_the_ethical_policy_desc코0=The Ethical policy was a splendid program, bringing welfare to the native population as is our duty as guardian of the Indian populace. Sadly, it has been greatly underfunded since the conservatives implemented it. With the social democrats available in the Netherlands, we can turn that around!
DEI_open_schools코0=Open More Schools
DEI_open_schools_desc코0=Better education means a better future. By opening more schools, we can learn more natives how to read so they can take on more complicated task, which will in the future help both our economies and technological progress.
DEI_werkverschaffing_for_east_indians코0=Werkverschaffing for Inlanders
DEI_werkverschaffing_for_east_indians_desc코0=The natives often fail to gain jobs just like the regular Dutch back home. By establishing Werkverschaffing programs, we can lighten this burden.
DEI_lift_bans_on_nationalists코0=Lift Bans on Nationalist Organisations
DEI_lift_bans_on_nationalists_desc코0=Previously, the Netherlands acted very frantically on the idea of allowing nationalist organisations, but we have to be honest with ourselves: we don't have the right to keep the Insulindians in chains forever, and if we help them and thus keep them happy, this will not be a detrimental move.
DEI_universal_suffrage코0=Cross voting
DEI_universal_suffrage_desc코0=The current system is fairly odd, only enfranchising a very small elite. We should allow everyone in the Indies to vote for the seats in the Volksraad. We can't get this through however without giving in to the demands that Dutch votes weight heavier.
DEI_alidius_van_starkenborgh_stachouwer코0=Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer Reforms
DEI_alidius_van_starkenborgh_stachouwer_desc코0=Tjarda van Starkenborgh-Stachouwer has been a dutiful civil servant since a long time, and it seems no surprise that the homeland decided to appoint him as our new governor-general. Let us welcome him!
DEI_limited_liberalisation코0=Limited Liberalisation
DEI_limited_liberalisation_desc코0=We should cut down a bit on the authoritarian nature of the colonial government. While it is true that we must safeguard our presence here, pushing too hard will only have adverse effects.
DEI_vr_extra_funding코0=Extra Funding for the Volksraad
DEI_vr_extra_funding_desc코0=The Volksraad is an important part of the colonial government, but severely underfunded. Even though it does not have a lot of power, it is essential in keeping policy in line with the interests of all groups in the Indies.

DEI_strengthen_the_volksraad_desc코0=The Volksraad is currently merely an advisory body. There are sufficient safeguards keeping it in check, we can make it a bit more powerful, with more checks on the governor-general's office.

DEI_congress_of_batavia_desc코0=It is time that we look into the future and recognize what is; in its current form the Dutch East Indies won't last forever, however, if we reform it can.

DEI_johannes_furstner코0=Furstner's Reforms
DEI_johannes_furstner_desc코0=Admiral Furstner was an unexpected choice, having had few administrative jobs and being more a man of the navy. He was however a founding member of the VNH so perhaps it could've been expected...
DEI_expand_the_pid코0=Expand the PID
DEI_expand_the_pid_desc코0=The Political Intelligence Service is the internal security service of the Indies. By expanding it we can more efficiently crack down on subversive movements in favour of 'independence'.
DEI_expand_the_papua_camps코0=Expand Camps in Western New Guinea
DEI_expand_the_papua_camps_desc코0=The camps in New Guinea have always been ideal to store away dissidents. Locating in the middle of the New Guinea jungle, filled with hostile tribes, no one would even consider trying to escape. We should expand them to hold more dissidents.
DEI_antinationalist_propaganda코0=Red Scare Propaganda Campaign
DEI_antinationalist_propaganda_desc코0=Contrary to popular belief, not everyone supports this 'Insulindian Independence' idea. We can improve this situation by putting out propaganda, amongst other things about the state of such a nation should it break away and overplaying the \"Syndicalist\" threat that would arise from it.
DEI_abandon_the_ethical_policy코0=Abandon the Ethical Policy
DEI_abandon_the_ethical_policy_desc코0=The Ethical Policy was a mistake, it only resulted in an educated elite who immediately showed that they were not ready, ranting against our rule. We should abolish it and make sure the Inlanders stay in the rice fields until they're actually ready for education.
DEI_restore_the_wingewest코0=Restore the Cultuurstelsel
DEI_restore_the_wingewest_desc코0=During the Cultuurstelsel system, profits from the colony were higher than ever, until subversive books started to undermine it. Time to bring old times back!
DEI_east_indian_apartheid코0=East Indian Apartheid
DEI_east_indian_apartheid_desc코0=Enforcing segregation may be frowned upon, but it is clearly the only way to avoid natives from poisoning the minds of Totoks and indo's with ideas that they should be equal.
DEI_cultural_imperialist_campaign코0=Cultural Imperialism
DEI_cultural_imperialist_campaign_desc코0=We have been here for over 300 years yet still they remain clenched to their own backwards culture. We should change this by actually starting to promote superior Dutch culture.
DEI_enforce_dutch_curricula코0=Enforce Dutch Curricula
DEI_enforce_dutch_curricula_desc코0=Despite our prolonged stay, Inlanders still tend to use Malay as lingua franca. It is unacceptable that such a language could fill that role when Dutch is an alternative!
DEI_eradicate_inlander_cultures코0=Target the Javanese Independence Groups
DEI_eradicate_inlander_cultures_desc코0=The Javanese hold plurality within the archipelago. By targeting only them, we can hope to create a power vacuum between the groups.
DEI_dissolve_the_volksraad코0=Dissolve the Volksraad
DEI_dissolve_the_volksraad_desc코0=The Volksraad is a group of poor old sods who think they have the right to criticize the governor-general on everything he does. It is time we abolish this abomination once and for all and centre all power in the governor-general.
DEI_new_beg코0=A New Beginning
DEI_new_beg_desc코0=With the Dutch East Indies now being split up into several autonomous states, the old administration is assisting this transition, though there are those who think this isn't happening fast enough...
DEI_new_con코0=A New Volksraad
DEI_new_con_desc코0=The old Volksraad was designed to keep the interest of the Dutch, and the Eurasians interest as a priority, over those of the natives. A new Volksraad is needed to ensure the voices of all the autonomous regions are heard.

DEI_indon_sep_desc코0=Reforms to the Volksraad have been met with fierce opposition from the -Malay representatives, who have unified against what they see as another attempt to establish a Colonial nation.
DEI_indon_coop코0=Insulindian Cooperation
DEI_indon_coop_desc코0=After some compromise, and some politicking, it appears that the current administrations have ensured that the Insulindian-Malay representatives will cooperate... for now.
DEI_indon_coup코0=Coup Avoided
DEI_indon_coup_desc코0=The conference of Batavia was just a ruse for the Insulindian-Malay representatives to gain an upper hand against their Dutch overlords. With the threat of a civil war, the Dutch have yielded to most of the Insulindian-Malay representatives, who seek to shape Insulindia into their own vision.
DEI_indon_vote코0=Universal Suffrage
DEI_indon_vote_desc코0=To ensure fair elections, universal suffrage has been introduced, though women voting rights appear to be left to the discretion of each state.
DEI_indon_borders코0=First Amendments

DEI_unitary코0=A New Republic
DEI_unitary_desc코0=The compromise with the Insulindian-Malay parties has resulted in a more centralised state, and it appearing they are willing to play the long game to achieve this.

DEI_unitary_2코0=Foreign Investment
DEI_unitary_2_desc코0=The new unitary state is looking to the East for its investors, though this could be a dangerous move, and a lesson that the Trojans learned from the Greeks.

DEI_shared_new_1_desc코0=A chance to tear the fragile alliance that is the Socialist-Islamist is upon us.
DEI_shared_new_2코0=Anti-Syndicalist Laws
DEI_shared_new_2_desc코0=Syndicalism does not align with our new nation or its ambitions and must be kept in check.
DEI_federal코0=United States of Insulindia
DEI_federal_desc코0=The transition process appears to now be forging towards to a single nation of a federation of states. This will allow each state a level of autonomy, and self-determination.

DEI_federal_2코0=Western Markets

DEI_future코0=The Future
DEI_future_desc코0=Though the transition from an autonomous nation under the Netherlands, to a nation state will occur slowly. We look forward to our new future as a free nation.

HOLEX_only_man코0=The Only Man in the Dutch Government
HOLEX_only_man_desc코0=If democracy had been a stable, helpful, defensive system then we wouldn't be in this situation. The queen should take full control over the direction of our nation, even if that means giving up some civil liberties.
HOLEX_together_out코0=Samen Uit, Samen Thuis

HOLEX_bargain_of_batavia코0=The Batavia Bargain
HOLEX_bargain_of_batavia_desc코0=With the exiles alone, it seems highly unlikely that we will be capable of defeating the syndicalist menace. We should try to cut a deal with the locals, if only to avoid a revolt while we can't stop them.
HOLEX_re-establish_the_cid코0=Reestablish the CID
HOLEX_re-establish_the_cid_desc코0=The CID has largely been forfeited in the chaos of the revolution, although many of its major officials are right here right now. We should refound the CID here. They shall help us defeat the syndicalist menace from the shadows.
HOLEX_political_intelligence_service코0=Internal: The PID
HOLEX_political_intelligence_service_desc코0=The Politieke Inlichtingendienst is the internal security service of the Dutch East Indies. They should be held in high regard because they are our best defence against domestic syndicalist tendencies.
HOLEX_expand_the_prison_camps코0=Expand the New Guinea Camps
HOLEX_expand_the_prison_camps_desc코0=The camps in New Guinea are ideal for keeping syndicalist thugs and other traitors away from the streets and more importantly, attacks. Located in New Guinea, no one will dare trying to escape through the rainforest with cannibalistic tribes hidden in the trees.
HOLEX_root_out_murba코0=Root out the Partai Murba
HOLEX_root_out_murba_desc코0=Since the destruction of the ISDV, the proletarian party of Tan Malaka has been the foremost radically socialist independence movement. We should crack down on them lest they entice the Inlanders into trying to repeat the Batavian Revolution here.
HOLEX_outlaw_syndicalism코0=Outlaw Syndicalism
HOLEX_outlaw_syndicalism_desc코0=Syndicalism is a disgusting system and should most definitely be outlawed to ensure our stability. It is bad enough that it has left its stain on the Dutch mainland.

HOLEX_activate_stay_behind_desc코0=Following the events of 1925 in Britain, the Dutch government realized that they might well be next to fall to the socialist menace.

HOLEX_a_natural_resistance코0=A Natural Resistance
HOLEX_a_natural_resistance_desc코0=Dutchmen are naturally resistant against oppression, and syndicalism is oppression by all means considering the limits they place on getting to be part of their government. By playing in to these feelings we can surely strengthen our internal forces.

HOLEX_prepare_the_bevrijding_desc코0=We should prepare the liberation of the Netherlands from the shadows to make it as swift as possible.
