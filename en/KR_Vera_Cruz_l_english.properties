### Leaders ###
POLITICS_LACERDA_TOT_RJM_DESC코0=Carlos Frederico Werneck de Lacerda was born in 1914, the year the weltkrieg started, and his very name is significant to understand him; Carlos comes from Karl Marx, Frederico from Friedrich Engels, as his father was a socialist activist as well who greatly admired the duo; In time, he followed in his father's footsteps, and joined the CGT and became a full time leftist activist as early as 1932, when he put his law degree on the backseat to focus on the political realm entirely. Long involved in the Demoratic Left and before that the CGT, he found himself rapidly rising in the ranks of brazilian syndicalist circles, thanks to his no nonsense attitude and oratory talent; albeit some claim this is due to his father's influence, not his own talent. His faith in syndicalism is unabated by the crises that followed the past decade on the world, and he took an active part on bringing it to his home. Now, has taken up the great responsibility of leading his new nation, and to finish the fight against the capitalist rot of former Brazil for good, and seeks to implement extensive reforms on almost all matters of state. However, his somewhat aggressive demeanour may result in issues both domestically and abroad when it comes to close negotiations.
POLITICS_MINERVINO_OLIVER_RJM_DESC코0=Like many of Brazil's poor, Minervino de Oliveira began to work as a child, and from his earliest years of adulthood he already was an influential union member, and also an early member of the Brazilian Syndicalist Party and contributor to leftist newspapers. By the time the New Republic arose, he was a natural candidate to enter the political arena, and he entered Rio's city council in 1928. In the next decade, his staunch defence of workers rights and support of strikes garnered him many admirers and even more enemies. In 1936, his support to the Democratic Left front of João Mangabeira was a key turning point in the ideologically charged and contentious electoral race. Thrusted into his new position by the liberation of his land, Oliveira is the first of hopefully many leaders of this relatively young nation, and hopes to create a legacy of equality and prosperity that will contrast with the terrible legacy left behind by Brazil and its political cronies.
POLITICS_CARLOS_LUZ_RJM_DESC코0=Carlos Coimbra da Luz was born in 1894 in a small town in the state of Minas Gerais, but later moved to the capital of Belo Horizonte to study, but the man always considered the town of Leopoldina, where his residence is located and where had had multiple terms as mayor. Having only recently joined the national stage of politics, Luz became a federal representative only recently in the 1936 elections with the ED, but since then has managed to maintain a steady political career, but always distrusted the further left members of that alliance, whom he saw as spies for foreign countries at best. An accomplished man who has performed varied roles, such as teachers, police captain and bank manager, Luz both understands the economic realities of the nation's hinterlands and the poverty that it's small towns have to endure, and has always positioned himself in favour of a less centralised taxation system, which is an oddity in his own party.
POLITICS_JK_RJM_DESC코0=Hailing from the city of Diamantina in Minas Gerais, Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira is the mother of a Mineiro father and a Czech mother, his middle name being the germanised spelling of Kubícek. After his father's death very early on his life, he began his studies, and eventually graduated from medical school and volunteered to aid in medical service during the Interstate War, and began his by now very long political career. Now faced with the challenge of ruling a nation wracked by war and in dire administrative straits, JK, as he is known by the people, has to not only deal with the ever competitive oligarchic politicians, but also with the ever looming threat of debt, as most taxation infrastructure did not make it past the war. But he also has big plans for both Rio and Belo Horizonte, cities in dire need of extensive public works, but already many in his opposition call these planes a \"hurricane of spending\", and yet he remains undeterred. Opposition to said remodeling is going to be especially complicated in Rio, where many attempts to do so have been thwarted in the past decades by numerous mayors and presidents.
POLITICS_TANCREDO_NEVES_RJM_DESC코0=Born in 1910 in the city of São João del-Rei, southern Minas Gerais, Tancredo de Almeida Neves started to take an interest in politics as early as age nine, and already as a young man he opposed the then ruling party of his home state in the crisis that sparked the Interstate War. While he at first tried to volunteer for opposition militias, his remarkably poor aim and physical disposition had him rejected, and he spent the war at home, while having difficulties finding a job during the economic depression that hit the nation. Some years after the interstate war, he joined the Republican party and began the slow climb through it's ranks, becoming a representative at city hall and the state legislature before heading to Rio's parliament. While his loyalties certainly lie with the Republicans, his somewhat moderate stances on key issues gave him a meaningful leg over other candidates, in what was a fairly contested election, even if the wanton violence of the war has been long left behind. His stances on economic and social issues are also why he has a relatively stable control of the upper and lower houses, but the complicated landscape left by the war may well surprise even the most skilled of politicians.
POLITICS_AFONSO_FEATHER_JUNIOR_RJM_DESC코0=Born in the small town of Santa Barbara in Minas Gerais, Afonso Augusto Moreira Pena Júnior started his career like many other local politicians, studying law and becoming a state representative. Even though he is a very successful liberal and a respected literary intellectual, he always had to deal with the looming shadow that his father, former President of Brazil Afonso Pena, whose achievements and legacy always seemed difficult to deal with, but now he too has become a head of state and a president of his own right, but unlike his father, who was frustrated at every turn by powerful landlords and political opponents, Junior is determined to advance and modernise this newborn nation nation to the standard enjoyed by European powers, especially in its farthest reaches, both in terms of education and infrastructure development. However, said endeavours are certainly easier planned than followed through, even with a relative control over the ever turbulent politics of Rio and Minas, there is no shortage of opposition for the so called radical ideas put forward by Afonso.
POLITICS_ARAKEN_OLIVEIRA_HOS_DESC코0=Born and raised in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Araken de Oliveira has always had the interests of Brazil at heart throughout his distinguished military career. A war veteran and respected officer, his current position as head of state is in no doubt due to the fact that only the remnants of the brazilian army can maintain law and order throughout Vera Cruz. While the suspension, at least for now, of any kind of elections for executive power is indeed a harsh measure, harsh measures have to be taken if this young nation is to succeed in re-establishing the rule of law in both its cities and hinterlands, a task Araken has to undertake for the sake of his home.
POLITICS_BELISARIUS_PITY_DESC코0=Belisário Augusto de Oliveira Penna was born in Barbacena, Minas Gerais, in 1868, and began his political career as a city councillor in Juiz de Fora, and only in the 1920s he projected himself outside of his home state, positioning himself in favour of right wing tenentist uprisings. For most of his life, he was a doctor and has a belief in scientific principles being applied to politics and governments. While a supporter of radical integralism, he often found himself marginalised even among that radical movement due to his beliefs regarding eugenics, a concept which he pioneered in Brazil, and he was for many years a member of the Central Eugenics Committee. These viewpoints have also granted him many allies and admirers that share similar beliefs, and now he and his associates are in a prime position to apply their ideas as practical principle, to ensure the great cities of the land like Rio are finally cleansed of its poverty and superstition that hide under the guise of 'local culture'. Belisário is also a supporter of utilising political prisoners as a workforce, a controversial and divisive viewpoint even among the right winger clique that now form his cabinet.
POLITICS_BIG_MOURA_JR_DESC코0=Olympio Mourão Filho was born in 1900, in Diamantina, Minas Gerais. Having followed a fairly standard military career, his first active combat duty was during the interstate war, where he was among the defeated officers that sided with the federal government. He has since completely and utterly lost faith in the very concept of liberal democracy, and has written books on the subject of a new kind of state, an \"Integral Democracy\". His republican beliefs have kept him somewhat distanced from the AIB, even if they did enjoy his full support in their ideals of dismantling the carcass of the republic as it currently stood. To him, an organic democracy is the conclusion of his studies and ideology, which also changed as the war took a turn for the worse. Now in a position to truly rule and liberate the lands of Vera Cruz from the blight of marxism and liberalism, Mourão leads the newly formed integralist movement in conjunction with similarly minded officers, even if many of the more monarchic elements have been tossed to the wayside, and will do everything in his power to ensure that his political mantra, where the Army, Navy and Paramilitary Militias sustain a united and strong integralist state where faith in God and in the nation are the principles to be maintained, instead of idolatry of wealth and syndicalism.
