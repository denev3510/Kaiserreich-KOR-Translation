### Leaders ###
POLITICS_DUARTE_BRAGANCA_DESC코0=As agreed in the Pact of Dover signed by royalists in exile before the Restoration, Duarte II inherited the throne from the heirless Manuel II. Since he was crowned in 1932, King Duarte has looked to strengthen ties with the Brazilian Imperial Family and with the British in exile in Canada, while at home keeping an amenable relationship with the Integralists, who fully control his government; a situation he will seek to change if possible.
POLITICS_MARIA_ADLEAIDE_BRAGANCA_DESC코0=Having taken up the crown after the second Regicide in 30 years, Maria III has dauting tasks ahead of her. The young Queen has always been popular when she was a princess, always looking to help people in need whenever possible. Her gentle and good demeanour may make her aggressive anti Integralist position seem surprising, but since taking the throne she has denounced excesses from that party, and her fearless attitude only helps her popularity
POLITICS_MARIA_PUPPET_DESC코0=As the recently installed Queen of Portugal and the Algarves, Maria Ana I seems content in her role of doing little actual ruling. Her priority is ensuring the preservation of the Monarchy and in restoring ties with the deposed royal family. Her husband's German nationality, once a liability that essentially locked her out of inheritance, may very well help in this endeavour

### Focuses ###
POR_matters_of_the_realm코0=Matters of the Realm
POR_matters_of_the_realm_desc코0=Following years of transition, we can finally mould the Kingdom into something great. The question is, who will prevail: the Couceirists or the Integralists?
POR_the_king_and_country코0=The King and His Country
POR_the_king_and_country_desc코0=The King will no longer be bound to the will of lesser men, who wish to deny him his divine right. The matter of ruling the Empire rests alone on His Royal Majesty's shoulders and those he sees fit!
POR_the_burden코0=The Burden of the Empire
POR_the_burden_desc코0=Colonies are expensive and, oftentimes, unprofitable. However, our goal was never to despoil or loot, but to uplift the condition of those living in our Ultramarine Provinces. Ensuring that we do not fail our responsibility should be of utmost priority.
POR_tarrafal코0=The Tarrafal
POR_tarrafal_desc코0=Tarrafal, a prison camp in the middle of Cape Verde, holds Portugal's most deranged criminals, keeping them away from both the Mainland and the Ultramarine Provinces. No one escapes Tarrafal!

POR_royal_edicts_desc코0=While the King may require assistance to accordingly rule, his will should not nor will not be overruled.
POR_the_moderating_power코0=The Moderating Power
POR_the_moderating_power_desc코0=The separation and balance of Powers between the Judiciary, Executive and Legislative branches works well in theory, however, as it stands, there are too many disagreements between these branches for the government to properly function. By giving the King the power to arbitrate such disputes, we can ensure they do not stand in the way of a new Portugal.
POR_persue_traitors코0=Pursue Syndicalist Traitors
POR_persue_traitors_desc코0=The internationalists are nothing but hedonistic intellectuals who have poisoned the minds of the masses. Thankfully, we have a cure; imprisonment at Tarrafal!
POR_ban_republican_parties코0=Ban Republican Parties
POR_ban_republican_parties_desc코0=The Portuguese Republicans have been tolerated for far too long; and as the time for the war between Portugal and her enemies fast approaches, we cannot allow these traitors to roam freely and undermine the State.

POR_realities코0=Political Realities
POR_realities_desc코0=The reality of the situation is that our nation is simply not a great power. Despite our extensive resources and manpower, we cannot hope to match the Hunnic or Syndie hordes that constantly threaten us. Understanding this and planning accordingly is vital in keeping the Portuguese state afloat.
POR_imperial_pride코0=Imperial Pride
POR_imperial_pride_desc코0=Portugal is at its zenith in terms of wealth and riches; our Kingdom has never stretched so far and ruled over so many. Few empires in the history of mankind can even compare to all that has been done by us since Vasco Da Gama left our shores. We have nothing to be ashamed of, bar the fact that we are not proud enough!
POR_centralized_rulership코0=Centralised Leadership
POR_centralized_rulership_desc코0=While many cities and areas enjoy a certain degree of autonomy, and some parties, such as the Intrgalists, see it as a good thing, it's abundantly clear that a more direct brand of leadership is required within our great Realm.
POR_moral_monarchy코0=A Monarchy of Morals
POR_moral_monarchy_desc코0=The Monarch has had to cater to the needs of lesser men for far too long in order to properly rule. Now, we can finally reshape the monarchy and ensure that his Authority is, in the end, above that of Parliament's!
POR_faith_and_state코0=A Faithful State
POR_faith_and_state_desc코0=Our state's main guideline is the faith which binds all citizens of Portugal together.

POR_the_organic_kingdom코0=The Organic Kingdom
POR_the_organic_kingdom_desc코0=Ideally, an acceptable monarchy should support the principles of conversion, tradition, municipalism. It should be both popular with the people and decentralised in its rule, both regal in how it presents itself and representative of the people.
POR_state_of_faithful코0=A State of the Faith
POR_state_of_faithful_desc코0=Portugal is and always will be a Christian nation. We were founded in His Name, we expanded with His Blessing, and, even now in our zenith, He gives us newfound will to continue reformation and better this world.
POR_youth코0=Portuguese Youth
POR_youth_desc코0=An idle mind invites sin; surely the youth of our nation have better ways to spend their free time instead of listening to radios and/or causing mischief. They can be moulded into useful and constructive members of society.
POR_peacefreedomandjusticeformynewempire코0=An Organic Legal Code
POR_peacefreedomandjusticeformynewempire_desc코0=A law cannot be imposed. It must emanate from the will of the people. A wise Monarch employs said laws wisely and rules fairly.
POR_state_priorities코0=Priorities of the State
POR_state_priorities_desc코0=Any state must always make sure to fulfil its responsibilities. Its utmost priority is infrastructure, due to such networks being shared between municipalities and requiring centralised efforts to operate.

POR_baroes_assinalados_desc코0='Que da ocidental praia Lusitana, Por mares nunca de antes navegados, Passaram ainda além da Taprobana, Em perigos e guerras esforçados, Mais do que prometia a força humana, E entre gente remota edificaram Novo Reino, que tanto sublimara.'

POR_suspend_parliament코0=Suspend Parliament

POR_expand_local_power코0=Restore Local Leadership
POR_expand_local_power_desc코0=The counts, dukes, and marquesses of the land have, for too long, been just titular title holders, indifferent to the lands they've ruled. Now, their role shall be altered, with municipal chambers taking the lead, so as to expand local autonomy over administrative matters.
POR_local_rulership코0=Local Autonomy
POR_local_rulership_desc코0=Who else would best know how to deal with problems within a community than community leaders themselves? They've lived within their local communities for hundreds of years, and can see more than just spreadsheets when they gaze upon the wheat fields and the hard working folk, who are toiling away.
POR_codified_decentralization코0=Codified Decentralisation
POR_codified_decentralization_desc코0=The increase of power and autonomy for local leaders can also pave the way for future conflict between the local leadership and the central government. In order to settle these potential disputes, a codified constitution will be written to ensure a stronger, and grander, Portuguese nation.
POR_abolish_parlament코0=Abolish Parliament
POR_abolish_parlament_desc코0=In his wisdom, and with much regret, the sovereign must inform the people of Portugal that the skeleton of the Parliament, with its outdated ideas, is to be banished; a House of Lords, the best and brighest of Portugal, will now exert legislative power instead of the opportunists within Parliament.
POR_economical_strongstance코0=Economic Strongstance
POR_economical_strongstance_desc코0=We cannot allow the economic views and/or the concepts created by politicians to get in the way of the new Portugal. Even if it means reminding some of them who truly holds power within a Kingdom.

POR_navy코0=Régia Marinha
POR_navy_desc코0=Our navy, while undergoing expansion during the Weltkrieg, is still not capable of properly defending our overseas provinces, nor our coastline! Relying on allied navies may not be an option available to us, so we must act now.
POR_raise_regulos코0=Raise Regúlo Regiments
POR_raise_regulos_desc코0=Our vassal Kings, loyal and thankful subjects, must realise that tensions between us and the Huns are quickly rising. If they do not arm their subjects, they risk falling under the yoke of the Hunnic Butcher.
POR_regulos_tooltip코0=One militia division will spawn in Angola
POR_colonial_war_effort코0=Colonial War Effort

POR_wareffort_tooltip코0=Raises a well armed division in Mozambique
POR_punish_traitors코0=Punish Traitors
POR_punish_traitors_desc코0=Despite our best effort, rebels within Mozambique have continued to exist and resent our glorious kingdom. These savages, consistently backed by the Hunnic menace, have now been left without their support and are at our mercy. We must make an example of them and all those who would dare preach disloyalty towards the Kingdom and barbarism.
POR_imperio코0=Ultramarine Effort
POR_imperio_desc코0=Our overseas provinces, while a centrepiece of the Restored Government, still lag behind in many ways when compared to the mainland and are, in many ways, threatened by those who envy what Portugal has done for her people. A new plan will be drawn up to ensure their safety and prosperity
POR_enforce_colonial_act코0=Enforce the Colonial Act
POR_enforce_colonial_act_desc코0=While groundbreaking legislation has been approved in the past decades, the laws have not been enforced within our overseas provinces. We mustn't allow complacency to take hold; laws are made to be enforced and we shall enforce them!
POR_protect_mozambique코0=Protect Mozambique
POR_protect_mozambique_desc코0=According to our top military experts, the best approach in defending Mozambique would be the forfeiture of its northern and unruly region, thereby establishing a safe perimeter within the Zambeze. Following this plan will help significantly improve our capacity to fend off aggression in Mozambique.
POR_protect_angola코0=Protect Angola
POR_protect_angola_desc코0=The two biggest cities in Angola, Nova Lisboa and Luanda, should be our top priority in terms of defence. We must ensure that our flag flies atop these cities for eternity!
POR_modernized_administators코0=Hire Modern Administrators
POR_modernized_administators_desc코0=Most of their colonial administrators, when granted their posts, sought an easy, laid back assignment within the tropics. It is time to replace them with new, energetic youth who will be engaged and ready to carry out our colonial mission.
POR_academia_imperial코0=Academia Imperial
POR_academia_imperial_desc코0=The greatest upside to investing in local talent within our empire is the fact that we can consolidate brilliant minds and use their efforts to modernise Portugal.
POR_casa_dos_estudantes_do_imperio코0=Casa dos Estudantes do Império
POR_casa_dos_estudantes_do_imperio_desc코0=A formal house for students from our overseas provinces, the Home of the Students of the Empire is now be a beacon of pride and efficiency. This investment in academia will surely have more... practical uses for our government, as well.
POR_colonial_development코0=Expand the Ministério das Colónias
POR_colonial_development_desc코0=Though a Republican-era institution, the Ministry of Colonies transformed the management of the Ultramarine Provinces, though its bureaucracy is now getting outdated. Our recent reforms have provided us the opportunity to overhaul it further, bringing it into the modern age and giving us an opening to invest in the more neglected holdings.

POR_capital_shipyrds코0=Capital Ship Effort
POR_capital_shipyrds_desc코0=Our navy is not to be sidelined and given a secondary role; what we need is a true modern fighting force that can guard our seas with absolute authority!
POR_blueprints코0=Naval Planning
POR_blueprints_desc코0=Building and projecting naval power is more than commissioning ships or naming them, but also a matter planning and expertise. However, this is not anything that we cannot remedy or tackle.

POR_grande_armada코0=A Grande Armada
POR_grande_armada_desc코0=Possessing a carrier fleet is more than having a few airplanes at sea; it is the possibility of power projection, both aerially and navally, and controlling the naval battlefield. Our battleships and escorts, which will defend our carriers, will rule the waves as the nation of Dom Henrique once did many years ago.
POR_the_fleet_of_the_empire코0=The Imperial Navy
POR_the_fleet_of_the_empire_desc코0=Establishing empire wide naval production standards and procedures will be a costly effort, but will most certainly pay off in the long run; The faster and more efficient our shipyards are, the sooner we can wrest absolute control of the seas!

POR_backfoot_armada코0=A Backfoot Armada

POR_escort_effort코0=Escort Effort
POR_escort_effort_desc코0=Escorting supply convoys to our overseas provinces safely is a task requiring the utmost importance. We cannot allow the lifeblood of the empire to face external threats!
POR_raiders코0=Modern Corsairs
POR_raiders_desc코0=For many centuries, Portugal had kept the Infidels near the Indian Ocean under control by using its tactical and naval expertise. Yet again, that shall be the primary goal of our new naval plans. Ensuring that we can raid, harass, and starve the large empires of our time.
POR_raiding_squads코0=Planning for Asymmetrical Warfare
POR_raiding_squads_desc코0=Planning a war against the world's biggest navy is not, by any means, an easily accomplished task. It will require much effort and calculation with our allies, admirals, and seamen. However, the tactics we use to deal with the War at Sea will certainly be crucial.
POR_submarines코0=Hunting Teams
POR_submarines_desc코0=One of the most crucial aspects of a raiding navy is operational autonomy and co-operation between the ships within the fleet. By organising our forces to act as 'Hunting Teams', which will be used to harass and attack enemy light ships and supply ships, we can ensure that our raiding navy will be extremely efficient.
POR_ubarcos코0=Imperial Submarine Force
POR_ubarcos_desc코0=Establishing empire wide naval production standards and procedures will be a costly effort, but will most certainly pay off in the long run; The faster and more efficient our shipyards are, the sooner we can ensure that our enemies will feel endangered at sea!

POR_angola_e_nossa코0=Angola É Nossa!
POR_angola_e_nossa_desc코0='Angola is ours! We will shout, it's our meat and blood! With no hesitation we defend, and fight, until we win, for Angola is ours!'
POR_trumph코0=The Triumph
POR_trumph_desc코0=Against all odds, the greatest imperial power in history could do little to stand against us. We won more than just our sovereignty, but, like the great Afonso Henriques, we don't fight for conquest but for freedom. As Aetius once did, we shattered the illusion of Hunnic invincibility, and people around the world will honour with us the heroes in our struggle! Não Passarão! Angola é Portugal!
POR_reward_loyalty코0=Reward our Loyal Subjects
POR_reward_loyalty_desc코0=We often see the true mettle of a vassal when his liege is on the edge of a knife. Risking everything, many who could have been complacent fought for us. Some out of genuine loyalty, others for the thrill of battle, and some simply to prevent the alternative: being ruled by the Butcher of Mahenge, who sees all non-Germans as little more than beasts of Burden. All will have their loyalty rewarded!
POR_redouble_investments코0=Redouble our Colonial Investments
POR_redouble_investments_desc코0=With pragmatist fears of losing investments waning as we reassert our authority, we can finally begin the new phase of Colonial Development.
POR_luanda_imperial코0=Imperial Luanda

Because it is the capital of Imperial Africa, monuments honouring our great heroes shall be erected in the future.
POR_zambia_e_nossa코0=Snatch Zambia!
POR_zambia_e_nossa_desc코0=Because of their thirst for earthly riches, the Germans have completely failed in their duty. They've alienated their subjects within Africa and the continent itself is in a state of disarray the likes of which has never been seen before. We can capitalise upon this opportunity and expand our empire, which will see the unification of our African provinces!
POR_pinko코0=The Pink Map
POR_pinko_desc코0=Because of the anarchy that has taken ahold of Africa, we may finally achieve the old goal of the Pink Map and exert control over vast swathes of land between Angola and Mozambique. While the war in the savannas, mountains, and forests will be a trying one, we fear not, for fortune favours the bold!
POR_congo_e_nosso코0=Remind the Manikongo of his Duty
POR_congo_e_nosso_desc코0=Since the Manikongo refuses to pay his tribute and does not recognise us as his overlord in accordance to previous treaties, it is high time we remind him who are the master of Congo...

POR_manufacturies코0=Manufacturing Focus

POR_guns코0=Arm our Soldiers!
POR_guns_desc코0=Our men fight like lions, yet they are, oftentimes, equipped as well as lions. We must ensure that every man is capable of performing his duty. To do so, we will provide the supplies necessary in order to ensure that our guardians will safeguard the Empire!
POR_armylogis코0=Logistic Battalions
POR_armylogis_desc코0=The sheer importance of battlefield logistics is something which can, oftentimes, be overlooked or even disregarded. Logistics is what separated the Romans from Barbarians and is what separates victory from defeat, especially during a modern military offensive.
POR_milfact코0=Armament Investments
POR_milfact_desc코0=As we proceed with the expansion of our military, we must ensure that each and every one of our divisions are supplied with all sorts of weapons. Undertaking such an endeavour, however, will be neither cheap nor easy.
POR_dockyard코0=Expand the Navy
POR_dockyard_desc코0=For far too long the Royal Navy has consisted of little more than mere escort vessels for convoys. However, with current tensions beginning to rise and war looming above us like an unwelcome shadow, we must prepare our shipyards for the potential conflicts that may come our way.
POR_dockyard2코0=Dockyard Renewal
POR_dockyard2_desc코0=Pre-existing shipyards are both outdated and unfit for the new naval expansion as they are unable to create larger, combat ready vessels. We must resolve this complication at once!

POR_milfac2_desc코0=We have redirected our primary focus to the expansion and increase of military production so that it can better meet our production quotas. If Portugal is to weather the incoming storm, it must be armed to the teeth.
POR_econimical_recovery코0=Begin the Recovery
POR_econimical_recovery_desc코0=The effects of Black Monday have left our economy in a much more critical condition than that of the Crisis of '26. and our markets are devastated due to an absence of consumers. In order to remedy this situation, substantial effort must be undertaken.
POR_focus_shift코0=A Shift in Focus
POR_focus_shift_desc코0=Currently, we do not require the creation of more factories, but we need to upgrade the ones we currently have and ensure they work at a swifter pace and at a higher quality. We can make this happen with our currently available resources.
POR_civfac코0=Consumer Goods Industry
POR_civfac_desc코0=To a certain degree, we need to wean ourselves off of dependency from foreign made industrial goods, especially for the basic necessities of our economy.
POR_christian_austerity코0=Christian Austerity
POR_christian_austerity_desc코0=An ideal citizen understands what is and is not needed. Luxury goods are not a necessity in times of hardship. Neither are all the amenities obtainable during peacetime. The Portuguese people possess the determination to persevere during these trying times.
POR_education코0=The Future of Portugal
POR_education_desc코0=As the prospect of war draws ever closer, we must ensure that we are prepared. While Portugal is small in terms of landmass, our genius and innovation led Europe to an age of prosperity, until the savage Huns enslaved the continent under their grip of tyranny. Let us ensure that, through proper funding of universities such as Coimbra, we can gain an advantage over our enemies.
POR_railwaya코0=Railway Expansion
POR_railwaya_desc코0=By connecting our provinces through the construction of new infrastructure, job creation and revenue generation will occur, which will ultimately benefit us from an economic standpoint.
POR_construction코0=Construction Effort
POR_construction_desc코0=The more we support state sponsored public works programmes, the faster we can pull ourselves out of this dreadful recession.
POR_naval_supply코0=Naval Supply Chains
POR_naval_supply_desc코0=An overseas empire, such as Portugal, is already under a logistically massive burden. To ensure our ports are up to the task of co-ordination is extremely crucial.
POR_railways코0=Companhia Ferroviaria Imperial
POR_railways_desc코0=The state has given us the go ahead to redouble our infrastructural expansion efforts. Because of this, we're now able to ensure that our infrastructure is one of the finest in Europe.

POR_army코0=The Portuguese Army
POR_army_desc코0=Portugal's performance in the Weltkrieg was shameful at best and dreadful at worst. This was because of the treacherous republican politicians who had got in the way of our top generals and honourable soldiers. No longer shall we allow our reputation to be tarnished!
POR_mic코0=Expand our Arsenal
POR_mic_desc코0=We must increase our capacity for producing better quality weapons as our enemies are already ahead of us!
POR_buildnavapower코0=Build Up Our Naval Power
POR_buildnavapower_desc코0=Portugal, despite its ultramarine empire, lacks the production potential to possess a battle ready navy. It's high time we began a naval buildup programme.
POR_miltech코0=Invest in Military Technology
POR_miltech_desc코0=As the prospect of war draws ever closer, we must ensure that we are prepared. While Portugal is small in terms of landmass, our genius and innovation led Europe to an age of prosperity, until the savage Huns enslaved the continent under their grip of tyranny. Let us ensure that, through proper funding of universities such as Coimbra, we can gain an advantage over our enemies.
POR_milindu코0=Defence Industry Contracts
POR_milindu_desc코0=As our ever expanding army demands and requires more supplies, further lobbying efforts are required in order to supply them with what they need.
POR_prodeff코0=Efficient Military Assembly Lines
POR_prodeff_desc코0=Despite our rapid industrial and military expansion, many of our assembly methods are subpar and our employees possess little to no behavioural discipline in the workplace. We must improve our standards lest we fall behind.
POR_linha_vedras코0=Revive Torres Vedras Lines
POR_linha_vedras_desc코0=Should the war in Europe take a turn for the worse, we must ensure that we have a backup plan. With the support of our allies, we can hold in the small area between the Tejo and the sea, where Lisbon is located, with a relatively small, yet impenetrable, fortification line. During the Weltkrieg, the Communards failed to break our spirit during their revolution and they will fail again!
POR_state_construction코0=State Construction
POR_state_construction_desc코0=As our needs grow militarily, so does the need for an underlying supply line.

POR_infeq코0=Infantry Equipment Renewal
POR_infeq_desc코0=A modern fighting force required much more than just guns; in the wet banks of the Zambeze, shoes are a greater necessity than tanks. Ensuring our troops are equipped with the best equipment will not only increase their effectiveness, but will also increase their morale as well.
POR_training코0=Infantry Training Effort
POR_training_desc코0=Moulding a young, hopeful youth into a soldier is neither cheap nor simple; but if we establish proper training regimens, we will be one step closer in ensuring that our troops are battle ready as soon as possible.
POR_artillerybattalion코0=Artillery Battalions
POR_artillerybattalion_desc코0=Artillery, able to reach where infantry cannot, is of the utmost importance in the modern battlefield and establishing dedicated artillery battalions is ideal in terms of ensuring operation cohesion with our infantry divisions.
POR_spotter_squads코0=Recon and Spotting Drills
POR_spotter_squads_desc코0=Often underestimated, recon teams and scouts are paramount to success in the modern era. Our troops will surely possess the upper hand when they can spot the enemy before being spotted themselves!

#POR_knights:0 "The Knights of Portugal" already defined above as an idea
POR_knights_desc코0=Despite our long history of operating from horseback being forgotten by many, the symbolism it portrays and its use for propaganda cannot be disregarded. We will ensure that our cavalrymen are of the best possible quality and spare no expense when training them!
POR_motorized_dragoons코0=Motorised Dragoons
POR_motorized_dragoons_desc코0=While the concept of mechanised infantry is far from fresh, using trucks and cars to effectively complete the job is a relatively novel, albeit expensive idea. Such investment will pay dividends in the battlefield, where rapid movement is key!
POR_loghtank코0=Tank Experimentation
POR_loghtank_desc코0=While our experience in terms of owning and fighting with tanks was limited to the Weltkrieg, we should ensure that we change this by undergoing the adaptation of foreign tank models and spur the creation of Portugal's first battle tank.
POR_tankarmy코0=The Armoured Corps of Portugal
POR_tankarmy_desc코0=The establishment of an armoured corps is an expensive effort, however we trust that this investment will bring us safety and ensure that we tower above our enemies on the battlefield.
POR_support_squads코0=Support Squads
POR_support_squads_desc코0=Those who do not understand modern warfare well are under the assumption that support squads are not essential in terms of combat. They could not be any more wrong.
POR_doctrine_reform코0=Review our Military Doctrine
POR_doctrine_reform_desc코0=A major factor of incompetence on the part of our generals was due to the fact that they were not knowledgeable about the modern tactics. By utilising foreign aides, we can ensure that our staff is not only up to par, but also innovative.
POR_herois_do_mar코0=Born To Rule The Sea
POR_herois_do_mar_desc코0=Ever since Portugal, in its current form, has been around, we've always controlled the seas, battled in the seas, existed and survived in the seas. We will continue to do so, using modern warfare to help better refine our tactics.
POR_our_legacy코0=Defend our Legacy
POR_our_legacy_desc코0=Our core values are threatened by, but not limited to, both barbarians and syndicalists. These mobs envy all that Portugal has done in the name of innovation and advancement. We will never falter and we will never surrender!
POR_suebi코0=Lusitanian Bravery
POR_suebi_desc코0=We do not fear death, especially not in the battlefield as there is no greater honour than to die in the name of our flag, our people, and our legacy!
POR_hearvy_art_batteries코0=The Grand Battery
POR_hearvy_art_batteries_desc코0=Our battalions will focus on the production of artillery or the grand battery, as it is known. Our shells shall darken the skies of all who dare oppose the Fatherland!
POR_paratroop코0=Paratrooper Training
POR_paratroop_desc코0=While the idea of using aircraft to aerially drop troops from the sky is not a new one, only recently was it successfully attempted and, even then, its usability and practicality are still doubted by many. What we need for such a manoeuvre to succeed is the use of special divisions, able to reorganise themselves after such a landing and fight behind enemy lines.
POR_wewerentexpectingspecialforces코0=Special Forces Corps
POR_wewerentexpectingspecialforces_desc코0=What's required in a modern army are heroes, grand fighters who specialise in one particular aspect of warfare. A force composed of the cream of the crop, who can best carry out the roles and tasks assigned to them.

POR_airforce코0=Portuguese Royal Air Force
POR_airforce_desc코0=Utilizing support from our allies, we can establish a truly modern air force and wrest control of the Lusitanian skies.
POR_air_superiority코0=Air Superiority Focus
POR_air_superiority_desc코0=An essential part of ruling the modern battlefield is also ruling the sky. Denying this simple, and factual, truth is to ignore the lessons of the Weltkrieg and the wars that preceded it.
POR_bomber코0=Bombing Campaign
POR_bomber_desc코0=Our resources would be best used in the creation of an air force which can support our troops and undertake long range retaliation missions against our enemies.
POR_fighterefforto코0=Fighter Creation
POR_fighterefforto_desc코0=Investments in fighter aircraft are crucial in the acquisition and maintenance of air superiority. The combination of our allies' expertise alongside Portuguese talent in the air will result in the finest flying machines known to man.
POR_cas코0=Close Air Support Focus
POR_cas_desc코0=Our bombers should be adapted to assist troops on the front lines, where the fate of Portugal will truly be decided.
POR_carrier_groups_1코0=Carrier Adaptations
POR_carrier_groups_1_desc코0=In order for our navy to reach its potential in terms of strength, carriers are required. Those carriers, however, require naval aircraft to help assist and defend our fleet.
POR_projection_of_airpower코0=Airpower Projection
POR_projection_of_airpower_desc코0=The projection of airpower relies on both possessing numerous aircraft and how and when that aircraft is best utilised. Aerial tactics, with its manoeuvres and intricacies, are no simple matter to decipher, but our officers are up to that challenge.
POR_strategic_bomber코0=Strategic Bombing
POR_strategic_bomber_desc코0=Bombing enemy production facilities and supply lines is a great way to stack the odds in our favour against better equipped and more numerous opponents. However, in order to do so, we must ensure that we have aircraft able to properly perform the tasks set aside for it.
POR_carrier_groups_2코0=Carrier Groups
POR_carrier_groups_2_desc코0=Training naval aircraft pilots to take off and land on carriers is a monumental task in itself, but adapting our existing aircraft to complete the task is a much more arduous effort.

### Decisions ###

POR_colonial_development_cat코0=Ultramarine Development Campaign
POR_colonial_development_cat_desc코0=The recently expanded Ministry of Colonies has been empowered to direct development efforts across the Empire. Already, various exciting developments have been scouted and planned, with an overarching aim of levelling up the smaller provinces to match our holdings in West and East Africa. It will take considerable political and economic capital to drive this development, but the vast wealth we can extract will be worth it.
POR_cape_verde코0=Cape Verde Development Effort
POR_cape_verde_desc코0=At the mercy of starvation and droughts, Cape Verde needs some sort of investment in order to prosper. We must draw up plans and invest in Cape Verde in order to ensure its prosperity.
POR_sao_tome코0=Expand Contratado Workforce in São Tomé
POR_sao_tome_desc코0=Plantations in São Tomé are underpopulated while Cape Verde is overpopulated. While the solution to this problem seems obvious, serious efforts must be undertaken to ensure that the workers will, not only, reach their destination, but to also ensure that tensions between both the locals and the immigrants will be minimised.
POR_macau코0=Protect and Develop Macau
POR_macau_desc코0=Macau is a crown jewel of the empire, envied by the Chinese because of its prosperity. However, it is also very far away from the Portugal. This means that, in the case of an attack, the province would have to hold on without support. To make matters worse, the government's hold on the province is also very poor. In light of this information, we must prepare initiatives to defend and develop Macau.
POR_goa코0=Defend the State of India
POR_goa_desc코0=The State of India, once safely protected due to the British control of the Indian subcontinent, is continually at risk of being attacked by either the Syndicalists in the east or the treacherous Princes in the south. We must make it our top priority to ensure that the State of India is well guarded from any foreign threat.
POR_timor코0=Open Charter Companies in Timor
POR_timor_desc코0=The far-flung Province of Timor has always been one of the poorer regions in the Empire, but recent studies by the Ministry of Colonies have uncovered vast new swathes of resources. To take advantage of the untapped potential of the province, the King will enact new royal charters to encourage a wave of investment and development in Timor.
POR_join_Entente코0=Join the Entente
POR_join_Entente_desc코0=It is in our best interests to join the British Empire in its global alliance, and fight at their side in the battle to restore world order.

### Events ###

por.4.t코0=The Kingdom of Portugal
por.4.d코0=After the disaster in the Weltkrieg, and the collapse of our forces in Mozambique and France, Portugal's usurper republic simply lacked the face and the military support to resist the Glorious Restoration, which brought Manuel II back to the throne, and his once rival claimant Duarte Nuno as his heir. The restoration, which occurred shortly after the war's end, saw the beginning of recovery for the economy. However, reliance on British imports and exports was too great for Portugal to properly weather the storm of 1925. We were unable to even unite our lands after the fall of the British Empire, for Germany, in an act of aggression, seized those lands. With such an extensive political crisis on his hands, the then Prime Minister Paiva Couçeiro called for elections; the victorious Integralists have an extensive reform agenda, while viciously anti-republican policies have polarised opinions even amongst the most staunch monarchists. However, they defer to the King for now, and they claim that they will so indefinitely. Spain's sickness seems to never end, as more chaos looms in the world and threatens Portugal. In Africa, Hermann von Göring and his Hunnic goons sabotage our endeavours, forcing our hand to return the favour, and tensions are fast escalating. But no matter what may come, we trust that Portugal will stand tall.
por.4.a코0=Avante!

por.300.t코0=The Colonial Exposition of [GetYear]
por.300.d코0=Thousands have gathered for Portugal's first large scale Colonial Exposition. While the Kingdom's restoration, and other trials and tribulations it has been forced to endure, have challenged it, Portugal did not shy away from its civilising burden and redoubled its efforts to improve the Ultramarine Provinces, which are as essential as Porto or Lisbon. Many wonders and trinkets from all over the world have been brought to Lisbon for the occasion, including an entire Angolan village as an anthropological curiosity. While the endeavour was expensive, it reinforces our commitment to the Colonial Cause.
por.300.a코0=Grand!

por.301.t코0=Black Monday Hits Portugal
por.301.d코0=While economic ties between us and Germany have never been as large or interconnected as with other European nations, the cascade effect of the Black Monday Crisis has hit Portugal with great force. With an economy mostly based on agricultural exports, and most industries focused on the rearmament plan, our usual consumers cannot afford our products and, thus, Portugal's economic situation is, yet again, in dire straits. Let us hope that we've learnt much from the lessons of the '26 Crisis and that we can, hopefully, recover much quicker this time.
por.301.a코0=This spells trouble!

por.302.t코0=The Coronation of Maria Ana I
por.302.d코0=As the old monarch was deemed unfit to rule and was forced into abdication, Maria Anna of Braganza has been crowned as Maria Ana I, and was recognised as such by the Chamber of Most Worthy Peers. Hopefully, her ascension will bring lasting peace to Portugal.
por.302.a코0=Long Live the Queen!

por.303.t코0=The Coronation of Maria Adelaide as Maria III
por.303.d코0=With the passing of Duarte II, who remained childless for the duration of his life, the question of succession had the chance of devolving into a contentious affair. However, his youngest sister, Maria Adelaide, was almost unanimously agreed as the best fit for the next Queen of Portugal by both the upper and lower houses for, despite her young age, she always was the Princess of the people. Long may Maria III reign, hopefully under peace and stability.
por.303.a코0=Long Live the Queen!

por.304.t코0=Regicide!
por.304.d코0=As Duarte II was returning from a routine trip to the Chamber of Most Worthy Peers, his convoy was assailed by four men, clad in black and well armed. The machine gun fire did not gravely wound the Queen, Maria Francisca of Orléans-Braganza, luckily enough, but innocent subjects of the Crown were gravely injured. The wounds of the 1908 terrorist attack were re-opened, and many in the Realm demand justice. While two of the 'soldiers' of the Legião Vermelha were shot down during the ensuing firefight, two terrorists spotted on camera, Mário Castelhano and Emídio Santana, who are apart of the well known Anarchist brigands, have fled, presumably to seek refuge in the Spanish regime of the CNT-FAI. Given the gravity of the crime committed, all options are on the table, including a harsh ultimatum. Careful analysis of diplomatic consequences would be advisable, but these two murderers will be brought to justice!
por.304.a코0=The CNT-FAI must surrender those responsible!
por.304.b코0=We must be remain cautious...

por.305.t코0=Portugal demands the return of the Regicide
por.305.d코0=While our struggle has been long, our problems are not yet over. Portugal's King, Duarte II, has been assassinated on the way back to his Palace after addressing the Upper House. Two men, Mário Castelhano and Emídio Santana, have crossed into our borders while on the run from Portuguese authorities. Despite the successful assassination, public reception has not been unanimous and many bystanders were wounded during the operation. However, the men were armed here and, by all accounts, even without the approval of the FAI, accepting the Portuguese demand of deportation could be seen by the world as an admission of guilt; not to mention the men are likely to face execution if we hand them over. Also it is important to remember the weight of this decision on a global level. Starting a war against Portugal and their reactionary allies while we are in a weakened state and so recently after the Civil War may prove unwise, even with our allies behind us. A choice must be made, regardless; Will we hand over the duo as demanded, or prepare for the Reactionary Retaliation?
por.305.a코0=We are not in a condition to fight the Entente as of now. We must comply with their demands.
por.305.b코0=We refuse to betray these heroes!

por.306.t코0=The CNT-FAI Has Handed Over the Murderers
por.306.d코0=Thankfully, the government of Spain has not completely lost its mind. They've refused to grant asylum to either of the two criminals and both are to be handed over to our authorities and be hanged in short order.
por.306.a코0=We have no choice but to thank them for their help...

por.307.t코0=The CNT-FAI Refuses Our Ultimatum
por.307.d코0=The treacherous dogs in Spain have granted asylum to the duo of criminals responsible for murdering our Most Faithful Majesty. Now every man must do his duty, for the final struggle against Syndicalism will soon begin!
por.307.a코0=As Armas!
por.307.b코0=We must back down, whatever the cost.

por.307001.t코0=Portugal Backs Down
por.307001.d코0=After all that, the Portuguese cowards have backed down from their ultimatum. This truly shows just how spinless they are.
por.307001.a코0=Coward and Capitalist both start with C.

por.308.t코0=Occupy Galicia?
por.308.d코0=The region of Galicia, Portuguese speaking in all but in name, and long under Spain's yoke, is under the very real threat of falling under the Syndicalist menace. While some Integralists argue for an intervention to protect our brothers, many politicians have openly expressed their concern at allowing Santiago de Compostela and the relics there to be looted by Anarchist bandits. Doing that could potentially weaken the Carlists even more, however, and will ruin any chance of good relations with them if they ever manage to turn this conflict around.
por.308.a코0=We must secure Galicia from the failing Carlists!
por.308.b코0=By doing this, we would be helping the Syndicalist Hydra.

por.309.t코0=Portugal Seizes Galicia!
por.309.d코0=The slithering snakes in Portugal have occupied Galicia while our forces struggle against the godless forces of the CNT-FAI. While they claim it's to ensure their Galician 'brothers' are safe from the yoke of Syndicalism, it's abundantly clear that this land grab is little more than blatant opportunism!
por.309.a코0=We will correct this later...

por.312.t코0=The Matters of the Realm
por.312.d코0=Much turmoil has befallen our Realm during this disastrous century. However, our nation endures and is stronger than ever. Now, the time has come to reform our government and wash away the last remnants of the corrupt republic, to help secure a better future.
por.312.a코0=The future beckons!

por.313.t코0=For King and Country
por.313.d코0=The Integralists and other manipulative demagogues have, for far too long, interfered in the nation's well being. The King, his advisers, and parliament should be making the decisions about Portugal's future; not pampered intellectuals living in Lisbon or hiding in Paris. We will shape the Monarchy into something truly grand!
por.313.a코0=Vida Longa ao Rei!

por.314.t코0=The Burden We Bear
por.314.d코0=We must rise above our petty differences and unite under our Faith, our Country, and our People. And most importantly, we must bring the light of civilisation to the poor and unfortunate souls who need Christ in their lives. It is neither an expensive nor glorious endeavour to build outposts in the dark of the jungle and spread civilisation, but, nonetheless, it is our ultimate goal. And, of course, so is defending our faith against those who seek to destroy it!
por.314.a코0=Forward towards a better Portugal and a better World.

por.315.t코0=Portugal Formally Rejoins the Entente
por.315.d코0=After the end of the Weltkrieg with the signing of the Peace with Honour, and even more so after the Revolution in '25, Britain and Portugal have drifted further and further apart despite being in a formal alliance. But now, as dangerous times begin to threaten us, would it be wise to turn to our oldest friend for aid?
por.315.a코0=We will renew the world's oldest and greatest alliance, and beat back the Syndicalist Hydra.
por.315.b코0=We'll refrain for now.

por.316.t코0=Portugal Asks Us To Rejoin the Entente Formally
por.316.d코0=After the end of the Weltkrieg with the signing of the Peace with Honour, and even more so after the Revolution in '25, Britain and Portugal have drifted further and further apart despite remaining in a formal alliance. But now, as dangerous times begin to threaten Europe, and the time to reclaim the birthright is fast approaching, Portugal asks us for support and will, in turn, provide support during the fast-approaching Second Weltkrieg.
por.316.a코0=With the renewal of this treaty, we will stop Syndicalism!
