### Leaders ###
POLITICS_ALI_SHIRE_DESC코0=Having taken up the throne of the Warsangali Sultanate in 1897 after a protracted power struggle with his father Gerad Cali Shiire, he descends from a line of kings that has lasted almost 600 years in the Horn of Africa. While being nominally subservient to British interests, Maxamuud Cali Shiire's support of Abdullah Hassan, the Mad Mullah, was crucial in defeating Italy in Africa during the Weltkrieg. A savvy political navigator, Maxamuud has united the sultanates of Somalia under a federal monarchy under his nominal leadership; but can a man who declared war against his own father for power be trusted not to infringe on constitutional prerogatives?
POLITICS_BARRE_DESC코0=A Marehan Darod hailing from the Ogaden, Siad Barre has always been a competent and enthusiastic officer. He is uncommonly young and surprisingly vicious with his enemies, and his ideological inflexibility certainly comes from his training from members of the Muslim Socialist Committee. His vision of a Somalia united beyond clan bonds is one that is bound to find resistance at every level of Somali society.
POLITICS_HAAJI_MAHAMMAD_DESC코0=Haaji Mohammed is the chief among a group of officers and intellectuals who defend the concept of a Greater Somalia above all else, and the unification of the people under one purpose. Despite his deep admiration for Abdullah Hassan, his group seeks completely detach Islam from the state, and such a measure is bound to unpopular at many levels of society.
POLITICS_JAMA_QUALIB_DESC코0=Jama Abdullahi Qalib is a young liberal hailing from Hargeisa. His faith on liberalism as the way to Somalia's future is admirable, but his readiness to work with foreigners has raised concerns on the populace, and so have his liberal ideas on the complete secularisation of the state
POLITICS_ADEN_ADDE_DESC코0=Born in 1909 in Beledweyne, Aden Abdullah remembers very well how it is to grow up under the thrall of Colonialism. His studies bring him closer and closer to Syndicalist ideologies, which he believes fit Somalia well; each clan is a trade union which works best autonomously, but most cooperate with its neighbours. He has been strongly influenced recently by French scholarship on matters of decentralised leadership, and hopes that he can ensure that Somalia's rough recent years can culminate in something good on the long run.
POLITICS_SHERMAKE_DESC코0=A Majarteen from Mudog, Ali Shermarke is a competent young scholar, well versed in both Islamic, Federal and foreign laws. He wishes for a non-aligned and peaceful foreign policy, but his wishes may very well be overturned by the influences foreign powers exert now on Somalia.
POLITICS_BASHIR_YUSUF_SOM_DESC코0=Hailing from the Osman Mahmoud clan of the Majarteen, Yusuf defends a more democratic and equal Somalia, even if he lacks the fervour for change that many of his colleagues do. His hopes are of a Somali Democratic Federation where the small clans and the city folk alike have their voices heard by the powers that be, and vows to fight poverty on rural areas of the nation.

### Tooltips ###
som.9.a.tt코0=Reserves are called upon and two divisions join the cause
som_locked_military_choice_tt코0=\n§YThis will decide the direction our military will take; a unified army or local militias. Choose carefully.§!

### Ideas ###
SOM_iron_fist_of_warsangali코0=Iron Fist of Warsangali
SOM_iron_fist_of_warsangali_desc코0=Warsangali is the leading state within Somalia, with its power base strong alongside deep German and Ottoman foreign ties dating to the Weltkrieg. While the capital is nominally in Mogadishu, much of the actual decision making is made in Las Khorey, and those who defy it are swiftly silenced.
SOM_gendarmerie_idea코0=Soomaali Gandarmaariiga
SOM_gendarmerie_idea_desc코0=Based on the western gendarmeries, the Soomaali Gandarmaariiga ensure that the peace and safety of the Kingdom are not threatened or harmed by radicals or other sorts of troublemakers; Anarchists and other deviants beware!
SOM_theclanassembly코0=National Assembly of Clans
SOM_theclanassembly_desc코0=Each clan, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant, now has the power to elect either one or two councilmen for the newly founded National Assembly of Clans, which serves as a lower house and is beneath the House of Lords.
SOM_xeer_checked코0=Xeer In Check
SOM_xeer_checked_desc코0=Xeer, or customary law, has always been something of a legally grey area. However, we will restructure it in such a way that will allow each state and clan to regulate its own laws to a certain extent. However, locally created laws shall remain beneath Somali State Law and this will, therefore, end the contradictions and loopholes that had existed prior to reform.
SOM_HANGASH코0=Hangash
SOM_HANGASH_desc코0=The newly founded Hay'adda Nabad Gal'yada Gaashaandhiga, or Hangash for short, is a Military Intelligence Unit designed to keep the balance of peace and harmony in the Kingdom of Somalia. The Boqor is now able to directly protect his subjects.
SOM_cashcrops_idea코0=Intensified Cashcrops
SOM_cashcrops_idea_desc코0=Because of the potential for famine, it is crucial that we store food reserves in order to best prepare ourselves, and the nation, for one. As it stands, our best bet would be to intensify the production of cash crops.
SOM_foodplease코0=Food Shortages
SOM_foodplease_desc코0=The prosperity Somalia has experienced, with regards to urbanisation, foreign investment, and cultural renaissance, has not been without its downsides. The growing population, military, and the lack of arable lands means that food shortages, while somewhat uncommon, still factor into rural life in Somalia.
SOM_lesshunger코0=Food Shortages Under Control
SOM_lesshunger_desc코0=Measures are now being taken in order to end famine in Somalia. We have begun by increasing the amount of arable land and have also begun purchasing foreign grain and foodstuffs.
SOM_nohunger코0=No More Hunger
SOM_nohunger_desc코0=Whether it'd be urban or rural life, famine is now no longer a problem within Somalia. Finally, it seems as though our future is bright.
SOM_BM코0=Black Monday Hits the Horn
SOM_BM_desc코0=Despite sparing us from much of its harsh effects, the ripples from Black Monday that had reached Somalia caused enough damage to wipe out our, admittedly, sparse industry as well as ruin our foreign investments, due to panic from investors. If we do not act fast, this could cause long term instability and lead to our downfall!
SOM_prodeff코0=Foreign Production Methods
SOM_prodeff_desc코0=Efforts are being made to reform and upgrade the few factories we possess in order to bring their standards up to date with Western ones.
SOM_great_again코0=Pan Somali Ethos
SOM_great_again_desc코0=Pan-Somali ideas have long flourished within the circles of certain intellectuals and military officers living within our young nation. It is clear that the time to act has neared. We shall unite every Somali under our banner!
SOM_osmanya코0=Osmanya Alphabet Endorsed
SOM_osmanya_desc코0=Cusmaan Yuusuf Keenadiid, the Suldaan of Hobyo, is a well learned man who had designed a new script for the Somali language. While his alphabet has received widespread acclaim and is used within various universities, academies, and other institutes, it has not been used within daily Somali life. We shall endorse and expand upon it as to adopt it as the official script of the Somali language.
SOM_osmanya_2코0=Osmanya Alphabet Endorsed
SOM_osmanya_2_desc코0=Cusmaan Yuusuf Keenadiid, the Suldaan of Hobyo, is a well learned man who had designed a new script for the Somali language. While his alphabet has received widespread acclaim and is used within various universities, academies, and other institutes, until recently, it was not used in daily Somali life. Thanks mostly to our efforts to encourage his alphabet and the offering of state-sponsored scholarships to prodigal students, the alphabet has begun to spread to the general populace.
SOM_university_rush_get_ballistics코0=Officer and Soldier Academies
SOM_university_rush_get_ballistics_desc코0=Our military officers, both well known and unknown, now have greater education opportunities and new benefits available to them. This will both improve the quality of our NCOs while incentivising prospective officers to join the army.
SOM_militia_1코0=The Local Militias
SOM_militia_1_desc코0=Militias from constituent states are now equipped with the best gear and weapons available, designed and engineered both at home and abroad.
SOM_militia_2코0=The Local Militias
SOM_militia_2_desc코0=Militias from constituent states now must train under a stricter regimen in order to better boost their organisation and coordination. We shall turn these men into proper soldiers, who will fight for the defence of the nation!
SOM_militia_3코0=The Local Militias
SOM_militia_3_desc코0=While maintaining their nominal hierarchies, CSMs now plan and operate as cohesive units.
SOM_militia_4코0=The Local Militias
SOM_militia_4_desc코0=Our irregular forces have long been the backbone of our armed forces and we shall follow the footsteps of Hassan, whom the thwarted imperialists have taken to calling the Mad Mullah, and we will move swiftly within the lands we know, while striking hard within the ones we don't, in order to secure Somalia's future.
SOM_cavriders코0=Noble Horsemen
SOM_cavriders_desc코0=The upper echelons from our constituent states opt to fight on horseback, while adapting their techniques to better suit modern warfare, also updating their training methods and purchasing state of the art equipment.
SOM_moredoods코0=Mass Recruiting
SOM_moredoods_desc코0=More and more men have joined their local militia to help defend Somalia; are you doing your part?

SOM_strenght_desc코0=While the prosperity and development of Somalia have been astounding, Ali Shire had made sure to follow a 'let sleeping dogs lie' policy in terms of politics. Meanwhile, Somalis had rejoiced, basking in their freedom, unquestionably of the primacy of Las Khorey. However, news of administrative reform in Ethiopia and Egypt have convinced the Boqor that reform are, indeed, required.
SOM_gendarmerie_desc코0=Maintaining order has been traditionally entrusted to local militias. The chief of each militia was entrusted with looking after the people. However, in order to better ensure peace and prosperity in the country, we must outfit a force of men who are capable of containing riots, protests, revolts, and crimes. This new force will be known as the Soomaali Gandarmaariiga, based off of their western counterparts.
SOM_negotiate_desc코0=The administrative model of the German Empire is an enlightened one and has pleased many of our Sheiks, Suldaans, and other rulers. The Boqor will rule as First Among Equals and every clan, no matter how small, will make up Somalia, each a federal unit.
SOM_unitedinwill_desc코0=So long as the Somali nation and its people are united—in spirit, in determination, and in outlook—we can ensure that no goal is too big for us to conquer. In order to attain that ideal, however, we must first focus on resolving the problems within the country...
SOM_theassembly_desc코0=Each clan, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant, now has the power to elect either one or two councilmen for the newly founded National Assembly of Clans, which serves as a lower house and is beneath the House of Lords.
SOM_constituitionreform_desc코0=A formalised constitution, which limits the powers of the states, territories, and of the union, will ensure that the pacts within the last few months are not but empty promises.
SOM_landofthefree_desc코0=Since we've now completed laying down the framework for a democratic Somalia, and have finalised the rules with the new constitution, it's now up to the people to decide Somalia's future. Let the elections begin!
SOM_justicetraditionsa_desc코0=Xeer, or customary law, has always been something of a legally grey area. However, we will restructure it in such a way that will allow each state and clan to regulate its own laws to a certain extent. However, locally created laws shall remain beneath Somali State Law and this will, therefore, end the contradictions and loopholes that had existed prior to reform.
SOM_crackdownonclanism_desc코0=Minor lords within Somalia have had the power to influence our decisions for far too long. Any notions of this facade of a federation must be dispelled, once and for all!
SOM_unityistrenght_desc코0=Somalia is a united nation, comprised of a singular group of people, under one sovereign. We had fought a lengthy and arduous battle to secure our future and we will not let petty infighting compromise that!
SOM_formalizekingdomstructure_desc코0=Somalia shall be, for all intents and purposes, a centralised kingdom in which the monarch has near absolute control. In order to bring about this new reality, however, a referendum shall take place to help determine the future of the kingdom.
SOM_tfwnoclans_desc코0=As a formality, to quiet liberal dissent, elections shall be held. However, by utilising the work of propagandists, we can ensure that turnout remains at an absolute minimum. Let us remind the people who had fought alongside Hassan and his brave men, and who had cowered and licked the boots of the Italians.
SOM_forthegreatergood_desc코0=Enemies about at every corner. Knifes in the dark, ready to strike at the elderly, fragile Boqor who gave so much of his life selflessly for his people. Traitors will be dealt with; swiftly and efficiently.
SOM_finishgovernmentreforms_desc코0=With the future of the nation safeguarded, tomorrow is brighter than ever. Now we must begin to plan for it...
SOM_economicaldev_desc코0=While our population has grown prosperous, we need to make sure that this prosperity is not something that will pass, by developing the economy into an industrial one. Our valued partners in the Porte and in Berlin will help us in this endeavour.
SOM_basicinfra_desc코0=A nation as young as Somalia will always need investments linking provinces and regions; especially if we are to truly modernise.
#already defined above as an idea:
SOM_cashcrops_desc코0=Hunger is still an issue within Somalia and food reserves are required in order to curb its effects. The best thing we can do is intensify cash crop production for some time.
SOM_endhunger_desc코0=We must begin to take serious measures to help end famine in Somalia. Our first step will be to increase the amount of arable land in the country and begin purchasing foreign grain and foodstuffs.
SOM_endhunger2_desc코0=We have effectively ended the disaster that was famine. Now, hunger is no longer prevalent within Somalia, with both our rural and urban regions possessing enough food to feed their people. Our future seems bright!
SOM_blackmonday_desc코0=Despite not suffering as poorly from the effects of Black Monday as the nations within the German economic orbit, Somalia is still facing a major economic downturn. This cannot be allowed to happen; we must take action as soon as possible!
SOM_warindustries_desc코0=A harsh reality that we must come to terms with is the fact that war has drastically changed in the past decades. We can no longer hope to preserve Somalia with outdated equipment, utilising the same tactics and strategies our forefathers had used. Modern equipment, rigorous drilling, and updated planning are all essential for our survival.
SOM_foreignmethods_desc코0=The few military factories within our possession must produce goods at maximum capacity and operate at full efficiency in order to give us a fighting chance against our imperialistic neighbours.
SOM_prepareforwar_desc코0=War is coming to Somalia, whether we like it or not. Presuming otherwise is foolish, for the envious powers, residing within Addis Ababa, refuse to acknowledge the loss of Ogaden, a region they had never truly ruled over. Our preparations and planning must be extensive, swift, and efficient!
SOM_lisencsingdeals_desc코0=We require the help of foreign experts, foreign equipment, and foreign tactics if our military is to punch above its weight and meet the demanding requirements of modern war.
SOM_infra2thereinfraning_desc코0=Connecting Somalia, from Barwaga to Zelia through the usage of railways and roads, is of the utmost importance. Our produce, our people, and our armies can no longer rely on dirt roads for transportation.
SOM_actualportsandairports_desc코0=In the past, our ports had been sufficient for both our imports and exports. However, with our increased agricultural and industrial output, the pressure for public investment for the expansion and creation of new ports is now increasing, especially among our coastal lords.
SOM_pansomaliethos_desc코0=Pan-Somali ideas have long flourished within the circles of certain intellectuals and military officers living within our young nation. It is clear that the time to act has neared. We shall unite every Somali under our banner!
SOM_statefunded_national_revival_desc코0=Our nation has had a glorious past and, ahead of it, has an even greater future. By sponsoring brilliant personalities and teachers who acknowledge this fact, and working hard to make sure our national pride is always high, we can truly make every citizen in our country proud to be Somali.
SOM_put_down_the_lion_desc코0=There are few things more pitiful than an old, sickly lion. Once a powerful empire, who had harboured the faithful in their hour of need, Abyssinia is now little more than an amalgamation of scheming dukes who play dress-up and impersonate German officers. It's high time we put this once grand empire to rest.
SOM_civilianindustry_desc코0=Our people are now able to afford new goods, imported from foreign nations. However, the cost of importing goods is far too expensive, especially for some luxury items. Perhaps it would be in our best interest to begin manufacturing these goods at home, instead of having our citizens purchase them from abroad?
SOM_constructechnics_desc코0=The reformation of any nation is never an easy job. While the task may be arduous, foreign expertise and skilled personnel will be required if Somalia is to be dragged into the age of advancement.
SOM_consumergoods_desc코0=Our consumer goods industry is severely limited due to low demand locally. By producing cheaper goods and exporting produce to nearby regions, we can ensure our industries will grow at an unprecedented rate.
SOM_politicalgoodwill_desc코0=Much of the government still retains something of a provisional air, damaging its legitimacy and power. We must strive towards uniting and consolidating our alliances with both clan leaders and intellectuals within Somalia.
SOM_increasealphabetusage_desc코0=Cusmaan Yuusuf Keenadiid, the Suldaan of Hobyo, is a well learned man who had designed a new script for the Somali language. While his alphabet has received widespread acclaim and is used within various universities, academies, and other institutes, it has not been used within daily Somali life. We shall endorse and expand upon it as to adopt it as the official script of the Somali language.
SOM_techslot_desc코0=Well prepared and intelligent students will now be granted access to higher education, which will greatly assist our universities as they will now be bustling with active students and fresh ideas. Of course, this also means the state can benefit from these educated individuals to help advance itself.
SOM_techslot2_desc코0=War is, oftentimes, a sporadic event which means we must plan and prepare for every single scenario. While our generals receive constant tweaks and updates to their battle plans, so must our engineers and planners who can help us best ready ourselves for any oncoming war.
SOM_higherlearning_desc코0=Higher education within Somalia is still lacking, and if our nation is to be taken seriously among the global academia we must begin heavy investments, the opening of more universities outside of Mogadishu, the education and re-education of our militia officers, and the guarantee of every region within the nation possessing a higher learning institution.
SOM_royalarmy_desc코0=Reforming the army is requires more than simply appointing new men to new positions. A new mentality is required alongside modernised equipment. The priorities and duties of a modern military force is tough in and of itself.
SOM_reformsreorgan_desc코0=The reformation of any army is always easier said than done. The first obstacle we face is where to focus our efforts. In addition, the question of centralising the army or allowing it to retain it a degree of autonomy is vital to its modernisation. Of course, such a decision would have political consequences, no matter what we choose, which is why further efforts must be preceded by sweeping political reforms.
SOM_clanmilitiaarmament_desc코0=Every constituent state will now require its own militia which will fall under our centralised control. The clans will be granted weapons in exchange for providing us with manpower.
SOM_isthatamiltiagungiseewithabursa_desc코0=While an army compromised of militiamen may be grand in size, it will fail against trained foes if it is untrained. Ensuring that our soldiers are trained using modern doctrines and efficient regimens is crucial.
SOM_clancavreg_desc코0=It has been known that, for centuries, the nobles living within Somalia have been proficient in the art of horsemanship. Providing these modern day knights with a purpose to defend Somalia is crucial if we are to better protect our nation.
SOM_hobyoyards_desc코0=Alongside his studies, the Sultan of Hobyo has also focused his attention on the sea and has made grand investments into the shipyards within the area. He has effectively bestowed upon Hobyo one of the largest and most up to date naval bases within Somalia. More is planned, of course, but in order to advance further the Sultan requires federal assistance.
SOM_logisticsformilitoas_desc코0=Supplying an army that is so decentralised as ours is no easy task. Logistical routes must be found and mapped out, and we must ensure that the supplies sent to our troops will reach their destination safely. Thankfully, we've men qualified for the task.
SOM_jointplanningteams_desc코0=We will gather up the best men within Somalia and, through the use of centralised joint planning teams, shall ensure that the states will strike together as one cohesive unit. We must defend the motherland!
SOM_mobilization_effort_desc코0=Somali men, heed the call for your clan, your family, and your country need you! Come to the nearest recruiting station to sign up to fight and, together with your brothers, work hard to ensure that Somalia shall never again fall under the yoke of imperialism!
SOM_magarteenartillery_desc코0=The Sultan of Majarteen, with his infinite wisdom, knew that our safety was transitory and, thus, had invested much into the creation of an armoury which is able to produce the finest modern artillery. Based off of Turkish designs, and funded through the Sultan's own pocket, we cannot let this opportunity go to waste. Let us all join forces to defend Somalia!
SOM_moblity_desc코0=Investing in advanced technology, such as tanks and motorised infantry, is important in order to keep up with the current state of warfare. We shall defend our homeland through the use of speed, outmanoeuvring our enemies and attaining victory!
SOM_advanced_naval_engagements_desc코0=By utilising naval doctrine alongside military doctrine and making sure that the two can work in lockstep with one another, we can ensure that our army can handle any threat, whether it'd be at sea or on land.
SOM_onkod_warfare_desc코0=Somalia's militia has long been our backbone and our pride. By following the steps of Hassan, whom the defeated imperialists call the Mad Mullah, we will move swiftly through lands we know and strike forcefully through the land we don't. We must secure Somalia's future through any means necessary.
SOM_unfiedarmy_desc코0=The army is an invaluable part of the state and it shall maintain order, face continual modernisation, and be administered in a centralised fashion, following the lead of the European nations.
SOM_factory_desc코0=Ensuring that we possess enough factories to properly supply a modern military is crucial to Somalia's survival. Such an effort will demand much of our attention and resources, however.
SOM_planning_strategically_desc코0=Our officers, eager to educate themselves in the ways of modern war, will have the aid of foreign experts at their disposal. This will ensure that the defeat of Somalia's enemies will be imminent, both on a tactical and strategic level.
SOM_tankbuy_desc코0=Tanks are costly, hard to produce, and infinitely harder to properly maintain. However, on the off chance that we can produce them, they will be an invaluable asset in any future wars and will give us a definite advantage over our enemies.
SOM_factory2_desc코0=Our factories must operate at full industrial capacity, producing military goods to better supply and equip our army. After all, supply is an extremely crucial factor of any sort of warfare and can determine the outcome of any war or, on a smaller scale, any battle.
SOM_equipment_desc코0=In order to convince our men that the army has truly undergone a reformation, we must provide them with new boots, new guns, and better rations in order to provide evidence of the effectiveness of our reforms.
SOM_modern_guns_desc코0=Artillery pieces and handguns within our possession are relics from the Weltkrieg era, some even dating back to an age far before the war itself. New equipment is required to modernise the armed forces.
SOM_support_eq_desc코0=We shall turn our focus to the production of support equipment and introduce logistical support training in order to better modernise our armed forces.
SOM_thatsthepointsarge_desc코0=The cream of the crop, men who are hand picked from Las Khorey by the Sultan himself, shall comprise the elite forces of Somalia. These men possess the most loyalty out of all of our subjects and have lent their full support to Somalia and the Boqor, above all else.
SOM_military_doctrine_effort_desc코0=War is raging worldwide, with countries pit against one another in a desperate struggle for victory. In order to best prepare for this scenario, we must remain aware of the tactical and strategic developments during these times and find ways to exploit them in order to defend the motherland.
SOM_support_companies_desc코0=Support companies will most certainly be crucial to future war efforts and are a must need for any modern fighting force. In order to establish them, we will require the support and knowledge of foreign officers to help train our men. Of course, everything, including hiring foreign officers, has a price.
SOM_inthenavy_desc코0=Somalia stands at a crucial point in its history and its strategic location cannot be brushed aside. If we manage to build up and organise a powerful navy and a proper air force, we may find ourselves in control of the world's busiest shipping lane.
SOM_royalnavy_desc코0=Currently, our warships are little more than outdated Weltkrieg era ships, sold to us by the great powers. If we are to wrest control of the high seas, we must begin the reformation of the Royal Navy. In order to do so, we require new ships, skilled sailors, and competent officers.
SOM_buildup_desc코0=We will begin a large scale naval build-up programme in order to help aid us in creating more ships. While this will prove to be a costly endeavour, hopefully it will grant us much reward in the near future.
SOM_strategicpatrols_desc코0=By using our ships to patrol and, thereby, exert control over the shipping lanes near the Somali coastline, we can ensure that our influence is recognised by all who dare sail in the Horn. In addition, by doing so, we can more easily defend and control the flow of supplies.
SOM_constrycnava_desc코0=Pouring funds in order to upgrade our shipyards is vital in terms of making our navy self-sufficient, improving the quality of our ships, and increasing our naval production capabilities.
SOM_raiders_desc코0=Our position near the crucial shipping lane of the Red Sea has put us in a position to take advantage of submarine warfare and, if need be, strike at enemy convoys with great efficiency.
SOM_hunterpacks_desc코0=We shall set up raiding parties in order to ensure that no enemy of Somalia will escape the Horn unscathed!
SOM_controlofnearbyseas_desc코0=Wresting control of the Horn and the Red Sea will be a gruesome effort, but well worth the gamble if we are to successfully do so. First, however, plans must be made in order to secure the area...
SOM_flagshipexperiments_desc코0=International observers may see Somalia as a small and unimportant nation that has no need for a massive flagship. However, if we are to defend our ports, the acquisition of one shall be crucial as, sooner or later, small raiders will no longer be sufficient in terms of coastal patrol and defence operations.
SOM_airforce_desc코0=The few planes that we currently possess were bought nearly a decade ago from the Caliph and the Royal Air Force itself is in dire need of effective reform and massive investment. We shall see to it.
SOM_fighters_desc코0=The most important aspect of aerial combat is controlling the skies, not the ground below. For once we have secured one, the other shall follow shortly.
SOM_fighters2_desc코0=We must spare no expense in ensuring that only Somali aircraft flies triumphantly in the skies above. Losing control of the skies, even briefly, is a dangerous prospect.
SOM_bombers_desc코0=A key component of aerial combat is complete control over the ground below as it's down there where all wars are truly won.
SOM_bombers2_desc코0=Our bomber crews are still vastly inexperienced, especially compared to their European and Ottoman counterparts. We will need their skill and know-how in order to ensure that our aircraft designs are modern and our pilots well trained.
SOM_airdoc_desc코0=Perhaps the most important facet of any airborne mission, planning is the key to success in the air. We must ensure our officers are well prepared and qualified to face the dangers of aerial warfare.

### Events ###

som.1.t코0=United We Stand!
som.1.d코0=The multiple states of Somalia were preyed upon by colonists and, in the eyes of the international community, we were seen as weak. We had fallen, divided, with brother against brother. However, after Abdullah Hassan's astounding victories over the Italians during the Weltkrieg, Italy had completely withdrawn from Somalia and the Sultan of Warsangali had, in all but name, slipped from British control as they were preoccupied with fighting the Germans. The Peace with Honour, officially concluding the Weltkrieg, paradoxically made Somalia free while remaining a protectorate of Britain due to Ali Shire's treaties. This status-quo, which had benefitted both parties, did not last for long, however, as the British Empire had collapsed. In a moment of what some may call opportunism, Warsangali's forces seized what was left of British Somaliland and the lords allied to him proclaimed him Bogor, or emperor, of Somalia. However, he sought to style himself as King of Somalia in the West as a way to court the monarchs of the Central Powers while recognising the ultimate authority of the Caliph. Prosperity followed for Somalia, with our fields growing rich and our cities larger. In addition, we'd managed to secure control over Ogaden in spite of the opposition from Ethiopia. Our roads, books, and universities are all symptoms of this event which has been dubbed the Somali Renaissance, but great danger may lie ahead for the wise understand that good times cannot be maintained indefinitely. Halie Selassie eyes our great nation enviously and Mittelafrika's new Statthalter remains diplomatically unapproachable. Whatever the future may hold, we can sit content with the fact that we have seized every possible opportunity presented to us and, together as one, leading Somalia to a better and brighter future.
som.1.a코0=We stand on the shoulder of giants!

som.2.t코0=Black Monday has Reached Somalia!
som.2.d코0=Even though Black Monday has done minimal damage to Somalia, especially when compared to the nations in Europe, we've still been hit by this economic crisis. Our valued trading partners are no longer willing to trade and our people are growing discontent, worried about what the future may hold. If we do not act quick to remedy the situation, this new attitude that has developed may make an economic downturn all but certain!
som.2.a코0=Uh oh...

som.3.t코0=Elections have been Called!
som.3.d코0=The elections for the Lower House will be helpful in terms of gauging the influence and power of the various factions within the House of Clans, followed by the House of Lords. The Prime Minister from the winning party shall be appointed by the Bogor, as set forth by the constitution. Three parties have a realistic shot at winning: The Somali Youth League, the Liberal Party, and the Royal Party. The people have cast their votes, and the winner is...
som.3.a코0=The Royal Party have won the elections.
som.3.b코0=The Liberal Party have won the elections.
som.3.c코0=The Somali Youth League have won the elections.

som.4.t코0=The Hangash have Captured Subversive Elements
som.4.d코0=It would be unwise to share more details, my Lord, but suffice to say these terrorists were planning to ruin Somalia from within and sell its fortunes to foreign invaders. Don't worry, however, as the threat has been dealt with.
som.4.a코0=Excellent.

som.5.t코0=The Referendum
som.5.d코0=The people are ready to approve of our reforms and confirm our status as the supreme rules of Somalia. The no campaign has, shocking, ran into many 'difficulties' and therefore a win is all but certain. All that is left is to commence the celebrations!
som.5.a코0=Everything is going as predicted.

som.6.t코0=Clan Argument!
som.6.d코0=Two major clans have found themselves embroiled in a disagreement during a session in the House of Lords. Both have begun the boycott of the others' actions and a political crisis is beginning to brew.
som.6.a코0=This is not good!

som.7.t코0=Hassan and the History Books
som.7.d코0=Mohammed Abdullah Hassan or, as he is known abroad, the Mad Mullah was the one who'd successfully defeated the British and Italian imperialists during the Weltkrieg and had secured Somali sovereignty and freedom for generations to come. However, Hassan himself possessed an aversion to personal representation and was an iconoclast who believed that photos would steal and trap his soul. The fact of the matter is, we do not possess the information needed to properly portray him, bar second hand accounts. How shall our history books portray him?
som.7.a코0=Carefully; we wouldn't want to steal the soul of such a great man...

som.8.t코0=Educational Success!
som.8.d코0=Our new curriculum has gained a surprising amount of traction, with thousands of children learning the alphabet set forth by the government. The Osmanya script will surely impact Somalia for the better and help popularise our rule.
som.8.a코0=Every poet began with a single word.

som.9.t코0=Hasnah Doreh Brigade
som.9.d코0=To the shock of conservatives, a group of young, educated women and their husbands have organised themselves into a brigade to fight for Somalia. They call themselves the Hasnah Doreh Brigdade and are named after the wife of Abdullah Hassan who'd allegedly fought alongside him.
som.9.a코0=Everyone is doing their part!

som.11.t코0=Barre Springs his Trap!
som.11.d코0=Damnation! As the Bogor was heading towards his palace, he was captured by disgruntled officers who abolished the monarchy. The Provisional Revolutionary Council has forcibly taken power and seeks to usher in a 'better, Totalist future' for Somalia.
som.11.a코0=We should have been more careful...

som.12.t코0=Haaji and the Nationalists Make their Move!
som.12.d코0=Disgruntled nationalist officers within the army have successfully launched a coup d'état and abolished the monarchy! A new Somali state has risen which is led not by the clergy and learned men, but by the military. They see themselves as what could have been, had Hassan not perished due to disease.
som.12.a코0=We should have been more careful...

som.13.t코0=Khat Tax?!
som.13.d코0=Khat is a major plant within Somalia. Everywhere, men can be seen chewing its leaves in bazaars, mosques, and even schools. Some have argued that since we now have control over what can be planted, we should tax the plant in order to profit off of it and control its export abroad. However, this will almost certainly be an extremely unpopular measure, especially in our rural regions.
som.13.a코0=Tax and export it; it's not like the demand will lower!
som.13.b코0=Taxing such an important plant can only hurt us.

#som.14.t:0 "Requesting Support from our Comrades"
#som.14.d:0 "War, chaos, and imperialism threaten everything held dear by Somalis. In these turbulent times, we must turn to the Commune of France and approach them so as to join their alliance and receive assistance."
#som.14.a:0 "Break the chains!"
#som.14.b:0 "We can handle ourselves."

#som.15.t:0 "Somalia Wants to Join the Internationale"
#som.15.d:0 "The efforts of the Internationale's Muslim Committee have brought upon us great success as the Somali Revolution has turned Somalia into a socialist nation. Siad Barre and the Somali people have now requested our aid, citing the turbulence their nation faces. Having an ally in the Horn could greatly assist us in future endeavours. What say we?"
#som.15.a:0 "We welcome our African brothers!"
#som.15.b:0 "This is wholly unneeded. Politely decline."
