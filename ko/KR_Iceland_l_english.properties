ice.9996.t코0=1922년 아이슬란드
ice.9996.d코0=1874년에 탄생한 아이슬란드는 덴마크가 식민지에게 자치와 헌법을 부여했을 때 처음으로 독립을 맛보았습니다. 덴마크의 일부로서, 아이슬란드는 세계대전 기간 동안 중립을 지켰습니다. 종전 이후 아이슬란드는 종주국 덴마크와 함께 미텔오이로파 경제블록과 합류했습니다. 이것은 아이슬란드가 주요 수출품인 어류로 두 시장에 진출할 수 있었기 때문에 이 섬나라에 번영의 시기를 가져다 주었습니다. 영국은 두 섬 사이의 거리 때문에 아이슬란드에서 수익성이 좋은 생선 수입을 계속했습니다. 한편, 아이슬란드 대구의 유럽 시장 진출은 아이슬란드 경제를 활성화시키기 위한 적은 추가 자금의 원천이 되었습니다.
ice.9996.a코0=한때는 그랬지...
ice.9997.t코0=1925년 아이슬란드
ice.9997.d코0=그러나 이러한 경제적 번영은 영원히 지속되지 않았습니다. 1925년 영국 혁명은 종전 후 아이슬란드가 겪고 있던 기적을 산산조각 냈습니다. 충성파가 제국 구석구석까지 달아나자 영국-아이슬란드 무역은 순식간에 물거품이 되었습니다. 대구 무역이 가능할 유일한 나라는 왕족들이 도망간 캐나다였지만 그들은 아이슬란드 무역 재개보다 더 시급한 경제 문제를 가지고 있었습니다. 그러므로, 미텔오이로파 경제 정책이 생디칼리슴 국가들과 어떤 무역도 할 수 없다고 명령한 이후 아이슬란드는 영국 혁명의 여파로 비틀거리고 있었습니다.
ice.9997.a코0=이젠 아니야...
ice.9998.t코0=1932년 아이슬란드
ice.9998.d코0=이 나라에서 증가하기 시작한 대규모 실업률에 미봉책을 마련하기 위해, 국회는 사람들이 육체 노동 건설 프로젝트에 종사하도록 하기 위해 도시 일자리 증가 계획을 만들었습니다. 이것은 한동안 효과가 있었지만 결국 정부 내 정당들 사이에서 불화의 원인이 되었습니다. 1932년 11월 9일 시의회 회의에서 시의회는 그 사업의 추진에 대해 토론했습니다. 경제 불황이 여전히 아이슬란드를 괴롭히고 있다는 사실 때문에 이 계획이 그대로 유지될 것을 요구하며 건물 앞에서 폭동을 일으키기 위해 집단으로 도착한 사람들에게 이 소식이 전해졌습니다. 이 폭동은 구토우슬라구린으로 알려지게 되었고, 도시 일자리 증가 계획이 가까운 미래에 효력을 발휘하도록 했습니다.
ice.9998.a코0=이 위기가 과연 끝날까?
ice.9999.t코0=1936년 아이슬란드
ice.9999.d코0=지난 10년은 아이슬란드 사람들에게 재앙이었지만, 여전히 지평선 너머로 더 밝은 미래에 대한 희망이 남아 있습니다. 유망한 정부 관리들은 일자리를 제공하거나 관광 산업을 일으키거나 심지어 우리 섬이 우리에게 제공하는 지열과 수력 발전 자원을 활용하는 것을 검토하기 위해 대규모 공공 사업 계획을 짜기 시작했습니다. 아마도 덴마크의 약간의 도움을 받으면, 우리는 이러한 꿈을 이룰 수 있을 것입니다!

ice.1.a코0=What a bountiful catch!
ice.2.t코0=아이슬란드의 어장 확장
ice.2.d코0=아이슬란드는 최근 북대서양의 상당 부분을 그들의 정당한 어장으로 주장했습니다. 이것은 브리튼에서 생디칼리스트들의 분노를 끌어낼 수 밖에 없지만, 이 기회를 이용해 아이슬란드에서 지지를 얻어 궁극적으로 고향 제도의 탈활을 위한 집결지로 사용할 수 있을 것입니다.

ice.3.t코0=아이슬란드가 브리튼 바다에 침범하다!

ice.3.a코0=거래를 시도하자
ice.3.b코0=바다에는 물고기들이 아주 많다
ice.4.t코0=캐나다의 거래 제안
ice.4.d코0=캐나다 상인들은 우리 두 나라 사이의 경제 거래에 관심을 표명하기 위해 우리와 접촉했습니다. 대영제국의 최대 후계국으로서, 그들은 한때 우리 섬들이 공유했던 무역을 재개하기를 희망합니다.
ice.4.a코0=오타와의 우리 친구들!
ice.5.t코0=브리튼 연방의 거래 제안
ice.5.d코0=브리튼 연방의 상인 연합은 잠재적인 경제 거래 조건을 논의하기 위해 우리에게 왔습니다. 우리 두 섬은 과거에 관대한 무역 거래를 한 적이 있지만, 지난 10년간의 최근 사건들은 그 거래의 종식을 초래했습니다. 그들은 지금이 그 거래를 갱신하기에 완벽한 시기라고 주장합니다.
ice.5.a코0=섬나라끼리 다시 무역하자!
ice.6.t코0=아이슬란드가 여러 무역 제의를 받다
ice.6.d코0=최근 확장으로 대서양 양안의 강대국들은 자신들의 몫을 차지하기 위해 경쟁하고 있습니다. 캐나다와 브리튼 연방 모두 증가하는 대구 공급에 대한 새로운 거래를 제안했습니다. 어느 쪽과 무역협정을 맺어야 할까요?
ice.6.a코0=캐나다와 거래한다.
ice.6.b코0=브리튼 연방과 거래한다.
ice.7.t코0=아이슬란드와 맺은 대구 무역 협정
ice.7.d코0=우리 상인들은 아이슬란드와의 거래를 성공적으로 성사시켰습니다. 이 거래는 그들이 경기 침체에서 벗어나 북대서양에서 귀중한 동맹국을 얻는 데 도움이 될 것입니다.
ice.7.a코0=대서양 횡단 대구 무역이 시작되었다!
ice.78.t코0=No North Atlantic Cod deal signed
ice.78.d코0=It seems that despite our generous offers to both the Royalists and the Syndicalists, neither side is interested in pursuing a trade deal with us for our catches. Due to this unfortunate series of events, we must turn eastward towards our fellow Nordic nations and attempt to align closer to them.
ice.78.a코0=Now we must turn inwards
ice.8.t코0=캐나다와의 대구 무역 성사
ice.8.d코0=캐나다가 우리의 대구 판매에 동의하였습니다. 우리는 이제 이익이 상당히 증가할 것입니다.
ice.8.a코0=A Sweet Catch
ice.9.t코0=아이슬란드-캐나다 무역 성사
ice.9.d코0=왕당파는 아이슬란드 지역 주민들과 우리 바다에서 낚시를 하고 우리 소유의 물고기를 잡을 것을 권장하는 계약을 체결했습니다. 우리는 보복하거나 이런 작은 나라로부터 멸시당하는 굴욕을 당해야 합니다.
ice.9.a코0=Contest the Waters!
ice.10.t코0=아이슬란드와 맺은 대구 무역 협정
ice.10.d코0=아이슬란드 상인들은 우리 두 나라가 과거에 공유했던 무역을 재개하기로 결정했습니다. 우리 섬들의 미래를 함께 번영시킵시다.
ice.10.a코0=대서양 대구 무역이 시작되었다!
ice.11.t코0=대서양 대구 무역 성사!
ice.11.d코0=이 거래의 서명과 함께, 연방은 새로운 어획물 중 상당 부분을 넘기는 대가로 우리가 그들의 수역을 침범했다는 문제를 뒤로 하기로 합의했습니다. 이것은 우리 어부들에게 더 안전한 환경을 제공할 것입니다.
ice.11.a코0=우리의 대서양 동맹을 위해!
ice.12.t코0=The British have made a deal with the Icelanders
ice.12.d코0=Those dastardly Unionists in Britain have struck a deal with Iceland for almost a complete monopoly on the cod sales gathered from the North Atlantic. We can't let that happen! Should we offer Iceland a new deal or quietly back down?
ice.12.a코0=A sweeter deal for Iceland
ice.12.b코0=A quiet exit from the cod trade
ice.13.t코0=Canada approaches us with a new deal

ice.15.d코0=Following this outrageous assumption of fishing rights from Iceland, we have sent a small detachment of destroyers out to stop this threat against our fishermen. The destroyers RNS Seawolf and Sparrowhawk have seen success in warding off any Icelandic fisherman who foolishly try to claim our waters.
ice.15.a코0=Britannia rules the waves
ice.16.t코0=Fishermen Attacked
ice.16.d코0=In the past couple days, our fishermen have come under assault by a small squadron of destroyers sent from the Union of Britain to contest the waters. Following these attacks, less of our fishermen are willing to trawl the rich waters that we have just claimed ownership of from the British. As a consequence, we are not able to draw in as many fish for sale.
ice.16.a코0=We won't back down over a few destroyers
ice.17.t코0=Retaliate against their trawlers?
ice.17.d코0=Some of our population calls for revenge against the British for attacking our fishermen. They clamour for us to equip some of our coast guard vessels to intercept British trawlers operating in our waters.
ice.17.a코0=Cut their lines
ice.17.b코0=No need to stoop to their level
ice.178.t코0=Fishermen still in danger
ice.178.d코0=Despite our quiet withdrawal from the contested waters, the British continue to harass our fishermen. They are careful to stay within our previous territorial waters yet the British still viciously chase down our boats. Once more the fishermen are requesting that we mobilise some of our coast guard vessels with armament to protect them. Who would we be if we just left our people alone on the high seas?
ice.178.a코0=Mobilise the coast guard
ice.178.b코0=We can't risk the British response
ice.179.t코0=어부들이 알팅그(아이슬란드 의회)에 행진하다
ice.179.d코0=계속되는 정부 지원 부족에 직면하여, 많은 어부들이 수도에 모여 의회를 향해 행진하고 조치를 요구하기 시작했습니다. 이 상황은 1932년에 한 무리의 노동자들이 도시 노동 창조 계획에 대해 폭동을 일으켰을 때를 떠올리게 합니다. 우리는 이제 어부들에게 굴복하고 해경을 동원하거나, 아니면 브리튼인들에게 자비를 구하는 두 가지 선택지에 직면해 있습니다. 정부는 어떻게 해야 할까요?
ice.179.a코0=The fishermen must be protected
ice.179.b코0=May the British find mercy
ice.18.t코0=British fishermen attacked
ice.18.d코0=We have received reports that Icelandic patrol boats from the coast guard have been equipped with net cutters and sent after our fishing boats. As the Icelandic vessel sails behind our trawlers, the trailing hook cuts our nets compromising our ability to collect fish. Our force in the North Atlantic is spread too thin to protect all our fishermen. We must send them reinforcements!
ice.18.a코0=Reinforce the squadron!
ice.19.t코0=A hero returns home
ice.19.d코0=In a daring raid against the British fishing trawler Carlisle, the crew of the Ægir found themselves under attack from a new British squadron that was freshly deployed to the region. The commander of the RNS Dunedin ordered his ship to ram the Ægir to protect their fishing vessel. After two ram attempts, the Ægir was barely left upright hanging on by a single screw. In an act of desperation, the commander of the Ægir gave the order to man the guns, in spite of the overwhelming firepower advantage that the Dunedin had at her disposal. Serviceman Guðmundur Kjærnested manned the 6 pounder to deter the Dunedin from finishing the fleeing patrol vessel off. News of the crew's heroism has swept across the nation and people are calling for the knighting of Guðmundur Kjærnested.
ice.19.a코0=Remember the Ægir!
ice.20.t코0=Appeal to the Canadians for aid
ice.20.d코0=While the Ægir was successful in beating back the British, we don't have enough vessels to sustain an attritional battle against the British. We need some more substantial aid to protect our waters. Something that the Canadians ought to be able to provide. How much should we ask of them?
ice.20.a코0=Request troops and a naval force
ice.20.b코0=Request just a naval force
ice.21.t코0=Iceland requests aid from us
ice.21.d코0=The Icelandic government has approached us looking for military assistance. The waters off their coast are becoming more like a warzone every week as the coast guard and republican navy clash against each others fishing ships. Without our protection, the cod deal we have running with them could wither away as the Republican navy could cut off Iceland. They have asked for a detachment of troops to protect the island itself and several vessels to ward off the republican forces. How should we respond?
ice.21.a코0=Send them what they ask for
ice.21.b코0=We can only spare the naval force
ice.21.c코0=We can't spare anything
ice.22.t코0=Iceland requests aid from us
ice.22.d코0=The Icelandic government has approached us looking for military assistance. The waters off their coast are becoming more like a warzone every week as the coast guard and republican navy clash against each others fishing ships. Without our protection, the cod deal we have running with them could wither away as the Republican navy could cut off Iceland. They have asked for several vessels to ward off the republican forces. How should we respond?
ice.22.a코0=Send them what they ask for
ice.22.b코0=We can't spare anything
ice.23.t코0=Send off the navy
ice.23.d코0=Today marks the departure of the newly formed Northwest Atlantic Squadron for the Icelandic waters. The fleet is composed of the destroyers HMCS Sterling and Tactician led by the light cruiser HMCS Dauntless. Command will be issued from the HMCS Cumberland which will serve as the flagship. Together, our proud men set sail to protect our trade from those godless syndicalists in the Home Isles.
ice.23.a코0=Good Luck and Godspeed!
ice.24.t코0=Canadian fleet arrives
ice.24.d코0=Our harbour was busy today as the Canadian ships we requested have just arrived. The British destroyer RNS Seawolf had been prowling after a few of our fishing trawlers waiting for an opportune moment to disrupt our haul for the day but the arrival of the Northwest Atlantic Squadron had the destroyer fleeing with its tail between its legs. The Canadian sailors were given a cheerful greeting by our fishermen on the docks as they pulled into the harbour.
ice.24.a코0=Welcome Canadians!
ice.25.t코0=Canadian armed forces arrive
ice.25.d코0=On a bit of a quieter note, forces from Canada have landed in Akureyri last night. They opted to take a more indirect route through the Arctic waters to avoid catching the notice of any British vessels. In the event that we are attacked, we will be better prepared to hold back the enemy.
ice.25.a코0=Reassuring
ice.26.t코0=No aid from Canada
ice.26.d코0=Disappointing news came today as our envoy to Canada has reported back that the Canadians are unwilling to devote any resources to help protect us and the cod trade between our two countries. We can not expect any aid from Canada from the Republican navy.
ice.26.a코0=We stand alone
ice.27.t코0=More lost fishing trawlers
ice.27.d코0=As the week continues since the Canadians neglected to send support to us, we have had massive problems with the Republican navy. Their bolstered forces are able to terrorise our vessels and restrict nearly all fishing off of our southern coast. We have contacted Canada to inform them of the cancellation of our trade agreement due to our inability to protect our fishermen.
ice.27.a코0=We must admit defeat...
ice.28.t코0=Fishing deal with Iceland is ended
ice.28.d코0=Iceland's fishermen are ruthlessly attacked without our aid which has severely diminished the amount of fish they can haul as fewer fishermen are willing to go out on the seas. To this end, the merchants from Iceland have informed us that the trade deal between our countries is at an end.
ice.28.a코0=Unfortunate
ice.29.t코0=Send an ultimatum to Iceland?
ice.29.d코0=With the situation in Iceland firmly under our control, we now face a crossroads. We could send some representatives to Iceland to 'suggest' that they form a new syndicalist government under our guidance. Or we could leave them alone on their island without any other major allies.
ice.29.a코0=Send some representatives
ice.29.b코0=Let them remain isolated
ice.291.t코0=Ultimatum from Britain
ice.291.d코0=With the Canadian forces unwilling to engage further, Iceland has fallen further and further into the British sphere. Now, Britain has sent representatives 'strongly suggesting' we adopt a syndicalist government and join the Third Internationale. What is not said, of course, is the implied threat of using force to enforce it - they will not accept a refusal. Without any allies left, we have little choice but to comply.
ice.291.a코0=We must bow
ice.30.t코0=Alone in the Atlantic
ice.30.d코0=As the cod war draws to a close, the Union of Britain stands dominant over us. However, they have contented themselves with merely leaving us adrift, alone, and allyless in the Atlantic. Now we must figure out what to do with our mourning country.
ice.30.a코0=Looking to the East
ice.31.t코0=Canadian Fleet Arrives
ice.31.d코0=The royalists have recently arrived in Iceland to help them claim our waters as their own!. The presence of their squadron has our republican navy on the back foot. We need a new strategy for our probes into the Atlantic.
ice.31.a코0=Get Aggressive
ice.31.b코0=Stick Together
ice.32.t코0=Aggressive strikes from the British
ice.32.d코0=While the Canadian squadron has been effective in stopping some attacks against our trawlers, frequently our fishermen have found themselves under attack before they can radio for help in time. With a force of planes flying recon overhead, we can get the edge we need against the Republican navy.
ice.32.a코0=Request planes for aerial recon
ice.33.t코0=All quiet in the North Atlantic
ice.33.d코0=For now, the skirmishes in the Atlantic have come to a close. The Canadians and British have been eyeing each other up as the fleets shadow each other's movements. Neither side has been willing to force an engagement as the Canadians do not want to be seen as the aggressors while the British are unwilling to make a move against the overwhelming firepower of the modern heavy cruiser that leads the Canadian squadron.
ice.33.a코0=Peace at last!
ice.34.t코0=Iceland requests scout planes
ice.34.d코0=The government of Iceland has requested a lease of scout planes to help our squadron better protect their merchant's vessels.
ice.34.a코0=Send them the planes
ice.34.b코0=We can't spare anything
ice.35.t코0=Canada sends scout planes
ice.35.d코0=The government in Canada has authorised the shipment of a wing of scout planes to help us defend our merchants.
ice.35.a코0=Thanks, Canada!
ice.36.t코0=Canada does not send any scout planes
ice.36.d코0=The Canadian government has told us that their planes are needed more elsewhere in the world.
ice.36.a코0=Unfortunate
ice.37.t코0=A daring plan for the Atlantic
ice.37.d코0=Admiral Norman Holbrook has come to us with a plan to break the Canadians stationed in Iceland. Recently returned from a hunting trip, Holbrook had inspiration come to him. Eventually, everyone falls into a routine pattern. He believes if we track the Canadians long enough they will eventually reveal a pattern of when they retire to harbour. Once we learn the timing, we can send a submarine in to blow their armoured cruiser before they even know what is happening, giving us the edge in the Atlantic!
ice.37.a코0=Authorise the raid
ice.38.t코0=The raid on the Cumberland
ice.38.d코0=Tonight marked the appointed night of the raid. Our brave submarine crew operating underneath Holbrook took to the sea and carefully made their way to the harbour where the Canadian fleet was docked for the night. Due to the lax nature of the recent conflict in the Atlantic, there seemed to be no real attempt to post adequate sentries to stand guard against something like this. As Holbrook surfaced he fired two salvoes of torpedoes into the HMCS Cumberland. The first salvo was ineffective, bouncing off the hull, but the second salvo ripped a massive hole into the starboard hull immediately causing it to list over and begin to flood. Following this display of fireworks, Holbrook and his crew submerged and began their escape back to the safety of British waters.
ice.38.a코0=In and out clean
ice.39.t코0=Claxons in the night
ice.39.d코0=Chaos rang out in the harbour last night. The peace over the last month has led to our guard being more relaxed than it should have been. For tonight saw the loss of our heavy cruiser the HMCS Cumberland. Aboard, we lost some 300 sailors as the ship sunk fairly quickly. We suspect some of the ammunition was improperly stored below the deck or a that a boiler had a mechanical failure overnight. No matter the reason, this loss is felt deeply by everyone in Iceland and Canada.
ice.39.a코0=Chaos in the Harbour
ice.40.t코0=Sombre news from Iceland
ice.40.d코0=We have received grave news from Iceland today. Overnight, the heavy cruiser, HMCS Cumberland experienced a sudden explosion causing the ship to sink rapidly. The cause of the explosion is not known at this time but the incoming reports list at least 300 sailors lost in this tragic incident.
ice.40.a코0=A day of mourning
ice.41.t코0=The fate of the Cumberland
ice.41.d코0=Following the tragedy of the Cumberland, we have dispatched divers to search the wreckage for any more information that we missed in the chaos of the night. By the afternoon, our divers found the smoking gun. Almost literally. They found an intact syndicalist torpedo of British design laying on the bottom of the port. This tragedy was not a mechanical failure but a deliberate assault from the Union of Britain against us! We will not stand for this!
ice.41.a코0=Demand an apology!
ice.42.t코0=Cumberland submarine raid discovered
ice.42.d코0=This morning we received a telegram from the government of Iceland demanding reparations for the sinking of the HMCS Cumberland. They claim to have indisputable evidence against us that prove we were the ones responsible for the loss of their ship. Our submarine crew claim they were in and out without being detected. How should we respond to this outrageous accusation?
ice.42.a코0=Deny our role
ice.42.b코0=Boast about our role in the sinking
ice.43.t코0=The British response to the Cumberland Telegram
ice.43.d코0=The British are denying their role in the sinking of the HCMS Cumberland. However, the torpedo we found is definite proof of their dastardly deed. The international community must know of the heinous nature of those in the Union of Britain to attack a ship full of boys in the dead of night.
ice.43.a코0=They will be forced to admit the truth
ice.44.t코0=The British response to the Cumberland Telegram
ice.44.d코0=The British have responded to our telegram with boasts. They boast proudly about their daring crewmen who were willing to sail into the jaws of our harbour to inflict damage upon us. They claim that they were only protecting their fishermen with a forward defence. The Canadians must know of the cruelty of their British brothers.
ice.44.a코0=Those devils!
ice.45.t코0=British Torpedoes found near the corpse of the Cumberland
ice.45.d코0=News has come from Iceland in regards to the cause of the sinking of the HMCS Cumberland. Divers found an intact British torpedo that failed to detonate when it was launched against the hull of the Cumberland. The explosion was not an internal mechanical failure after all but an insidious attempt by the British to cowardly attack us during the night. Our people clamour for revenge over the loss of our young men aboard the Cumberland who never made it to shore.
ice.45.a코0=The people shall be heard!
ice.46.t코0=Spies report back from Canada
ice.46.d코0=Our spies in Canada have reported back to us about the public opinion in Canada towards Iceland since the sinking of the Cumberland. In contrast to what we thought, the surprise attack did not discourage them but rather embolden them. They remain resolute in their commitment to Iceland. How should we proceed?
ice.46.a코0=Blockade Iceland
ice.46.b코0=Back Down
ice.47.t코0=Free reign over the waters!
ice.47.d코0=In an unexpected turn of events, the British have opted to back down from the skirmishes in the Icelandic waters. This places us as the undisputed masters of the waves around our island. Our fishermen are now free to resume catching fish without fear of any attacks from the Republican navy. We could not have done this without the aid of Canada.
ice.47.a코0=Britannia no longer rules the waves
ice.48.t코0=Ships all across the horizon
ice.48.d코0=This morning our merchants woke to a horrifying sight: the horizon filled with British warships. In a display of power, the British have stationed their supercarrier the Rebecca 5 miles off the shore from Reykjavik. Bombers have flown over Reykjavik dropping thousands of pamphlets that state that our trade with the Canadians is now at an end and that we are strongly advised to heed whatever demands the British send to us.
ice.48.a코0=Cut off from our friends in the west
ice.49.t코0=North Sea Squadron Trapped
ice.49.d코0=As the British descend on Iceland, our detachment of ships has become trapped in the Icelandic ports. Any attempt to break out of the blockade would be a bloodbath. They are effectively trapped.
ice.49.a코0=May God help them
ice.50.t코0=아이슬란드 해상봉쇄
ice.50.d코0=Our blockade over the course of the last week has been a great success. All trade with the royalists in Canada has ceased on Iceland. Our intelligence reports no action from the Canadians to relieve their trapped squadron of sailors in Iceland. We have Iceland right where we want them.
ice.50.a코0=A successful operation
ice.51.t코0=Delivering the Demands
ice.51.d코0=Following a two week period of blockade, their merchants and traders must be desperate for some ability to resume trade. We have proposed a treaty for them. In the deal, we press our claims over the waters, which naturally give us a sizeable portion of all profits that come from fish caught by Icelandic fishermen. Any disagreement with said policy would be seen as an attack against our sovereign waters and would be subject for military intervention.
ice.51.a코0=Force their hand
ice.52.t코0=Britain offers a new deal
ice.52.d코0=British merchants delivered an ultimatum to our merchants earlier today. They landed at Reykjavik and demanded a meeting with the prominent traders of Iceland. They brought with them a document in which they pressed their claims over the waters, which entitled them to a sizeable portion of all profits from fish caught by Icelandic fishermen. Any disagreement with their deal would be seen as an attack against their sovereign waters and they say they will not hesitate to send in the military to ensure we honour the bargain.
ice.52.a코0=Reject their extortion
ice.52.b코0=We have no choice but to bow
ice.53.t코0=Organising the Defence of Iceland
ice.53.d코0=Following our rejection of their ridiculous demands, the British merchants left in a big huff of hot air. We don't expect they would make any empty threats after their raid on the Cumberland. Therefore, we must prepare for their incoming attack. How should we proceed?
ice.53.a코0=To arms!
ice.53.b코0=Organise an underground resistance
ice.54.t코0=Iceland rejects our demands
ice.54.d코0=With their rejection of our terms, we now have a justifiable excuse to land forces on their island. They have no military of any means and would have no means to resist us. Should we land a large force in a display of power, or use our resources elsewhere and deploy a smaller force?
ice.54.a코0=Display our power
ice.54.b코0=A small force will do the job
ice.55.t코0=Iceland lies defeated
ice.55.d코0=The Icelanders attempted to offer up resistance with the help of their Canadian allies at the beaches. They, however, were no match for our Republican marines who made short work of them. We now stand atop our conquered isle.
ice.55.a코0=Triumph
ice.56.t코0=Uncontested Landing
ice.56.d코0=Our forces have successfully landed on Iceland. The locals put up no resistance and we were able to quickly secure key positions throughout Reykjavik and take control of the island.
ice.56.a코0=Who can hope to stand against us?
ice.57.t코0=Operation Fork Foiled!
ice.57.d코0=We underestimated the tenacity of the Icelandic people. They were able to mount a sturdy defence with the aid of their Canadian allies and beat back our small landing parties into the sea. With this setback, we look like fools on the international scene with our failure to project power against a country as small as Iceland.
ice.57.a코0=How could this happen?
ice.58.t코0=Defeat in Iceland
ice.58.d코0=Our forces attempted to fight a pitched battle to retain control of Iceland. Unfortunately, the British came in too large numbers and were able to defeat us.
ice.58.a코0=Catastrophe!
ice.59.t코0=Organise a commando resistance?
ice.59.d코0=Without boots on the ground, our visible presence in Iceland has been finished. Should we attempt to send commandos to Iceland to help organise a local resistance against British rule?
ice.59.a코0=A good idea
ice.59.b코0=Too risky
ice.591.t코0=Organise a commando resistance?
ice.591.d코0=The people of Iceland are not content to lie under the heel of the Union of Britain. They have requested that we send a small force of commandos to help them drive off the British. Should we send them?
ice.591.a코0=Send the men
ice.591.b코0=The plan is too risky
ice.60.t코0=Defeat in the field
ice.60.d코0=We gambled everything we had on this one attempt to drive the British back. Despite our best efforts, the British simply kept coming and blew through our limited defenders. The British have been quick to implement martial law and our government does not have long until they receive a demand that they can not refuse.
ice.60.a코0=Once more under the yoke
ice.61.t코0=Iceland's new government
ice.61.d코0=With our conquest of the island, our delegations have been busy drafting up a new government for us to install on Iceland. The previously marginalised syndicalist population will be given control of a new Althing that ultimately answers to us.
ice.61.a코0=A new government for the island
ice.62.t코0=British troops in Reykjavik
ice.62.d코0=British troops landed on Iceland earlier today and quickly seized control of all the key government buildings. The Althing is expecting to receive demands from the Union of Britain any day now.
ice.62.a코0=We stood no chance
ice.63.t코0=British troops beaten back
ice.63.d코0=Our forces in Iceland successfully held off a British attack on the island. Their heroism will be remembered for a long time as revenge for the Cumberland!
ice.63.a코0=Remember the Cumberland!
ice.64.t코0=Successful defence of Iceland
ice.64.d코0=Our Canadian allies were able to push the British back into the sea when they attempted a landing with a small contingent of troops. For now, the island retains its independence.
ice.64.a코0=Thanks to Canada!
ice.65.t코0=The Icelandic Question
ice.65.d코0=With the failure of our ground forces, the navy has come forward to offer their support for a new operation. This would involve sailing the Rebecca right off the port of Reykjavik and sending bombers to target their infrastructure and harbour facilities to demonstrate what we are capable of. This would likely draw the ire of the international community. Our other option would be to back down out of the waters and hope that this debacle fades from memory.
ice.65.a코0=Make an example of Iceland
ice.65.b코0=Back Down
ice.66.t코0=Britain backs down from the Atlantic
ice.66.d코0=The representative from the Union of Britain has announced that the Union of Britain is withdrawing from its current affairs in the North Atlantic. This means we are free to align ourselves with our Canadian trade partners and protectors.
ice.66.a코0=Free from their tyranny
ice.67.t코0=Reykjavik bombed!
ice.67.d코0=Panic broke out overnight as the RNS Rebecca sailed up to the Reykjavik port and launched wave after wave of bombers. They struck with precision crippling what little infrastructure we have and the port facilities. Other waves dropped mass pamphlets that called for Iceland to adopt a policy of isolation in the Atlantic. It will take some time to rebuild this damage!
ice.67.a코0=Luckily the people are alright
ice.74.t코0=The Austerity Budget
ice.74.d코0=As the markets start to hike their prices, we must turn inwards and try to reduce our reliance on imports from elsewhere.
ice.74.a코0=Moderate adherence to austerity!
ice.74.b코0=A small austerity budget!
ice.75.t코0=The Question of Fund Allocation
ice.75.d코0=As our nation is thrown into great economic crisis, the people have cried out in a request for aid. Our coffers are very light so we will only be able to send a token gesture to one side. Who should we help relieve?
ice.75.a코0=Support the Rural Areas
ice.75.b코0=Support the Urban Area
ice.76.t코0=Members of the Reykjavik Council protest
ice.76.d코0=Over the past twenty years, the city of Reykjavik has more than doubled in population. With the crash of global imports post-Black Monday, the inhabitants are facing dire times. The Council has pleaded with us to help them if we find more money in the budget.
ice.76.a코0=If we find the money...
ice.76.b코0=The rural population needs our help more
ice.77.t코0=The Rural Population Protests
ice.77.d코0=Since we have elected to give our resources to support the urban population of Iceland, the post has been filled with letters from the outlying communities with their complaints. They argue that their goods are what give those in the city jobs and that without the rural community, the urban community would be unable to survive.
ice.77.a코0=If we find the money...
ice.77.b코0=A strong capital will share its wealth out later
ice.80.t코0=Public Radio Broadcasts
ice.80.d코0=People all across the Island have started to gather to listen to the Prime Minister speak on the radio. Almost all radios are tuned to hear him as he tells the people how the Althingi is taking steps to fix the instability that is facing their country.
ice.80.a코0=How Reassuring
ice.81.t코0=Continue the Radio Broadcasts?
ice.81.d코0=The people are greatly in favour of the radio broadcasts that have been given out to the nation to assure their worries over the course of the past year. Now we must ask ourselves if we wish to continue the broadcasts for another year.
ice.81.a코0=The people need the comfort
ice.81.b코0=Our efforts are better spent elsewhere
ice.82.t코0=Iceland Asks for Financial Relief
ice.82.d코0=The government of Iceland has come forward to us with a request for financial assistance during this crisis that we find ourselves in after Black Monday. They claim that with the injection of Danish cash into the Icelandic economy, they will be able to finance their own recovery programs. The amount that they ask for is relatively small due to the difference in population density between our two nations. Should we grant them this request?
ice.82.a코0=We must help our people!
ice.82.b코0=They must help themselves
ice.83.t코0=Denmark sends Financial Relief
ice.83.d코0=The government of Denmark heard our pleas and responded with grace. They have granted us a very generous sum of money to kickstart relief programs to get our nation back on its feet!
ice.83.a코0=Thank you, Denmark!
ice.84.t코0=Denmark Withholds Relief
ice.84.d코0=Our pleas fell on hard hearts when we requested a bailout from Denmark. They claim that the economic crisis is hitting them too hard at home to provide any relief for us. We will have to make do with what we have on hand.
ice.84.a코0=We must weather this alone
ice.85.t코0=A Charitable People
ice.85.d코0=The people of Iceland have gone above and beyond to reach out a helping hand to their neighbours in need. Churches all across the island have started donation drives and opened their doors to any and all who come seeking help. If everyone could love their neighbour as much as these men and women do, then the world might just turn out to be a better place.
ice.85.a코0=May the Lord smile on their kindness
ice.86.t코0=Running a Census
ice.86.d코0=With our commitment to aiding the rural population, we need an accurate account of where they are located and in what numbers. Due to the general lack of communications infrastructure across the island, the census must be taken via messengers sent out from Reykjavik. Many generous herders near Reykjavik have offered some of their horses to be used to send riders off.
ice.86.a코0=Send out the riders
ice.87.t코0=Sending Out Aid
ice.87.d코0=With preliminary reports coming in, the aid for the rural population has begun to be doled out to the people. Carts and wagons are loaded up and then sent in teams out into the countryside to reach the more remote settlements on the island.
ice.87.a코0=They will surely appreciate this
ice.90.t코0=Temperance Movement Protests
ice.90.d코0=With the repeal of prohibition, the International Order of Good Templars have expressed their dissatisfaction with our recent policy change. They claim that this will lead to societal corruption as the tree of life and prosperity needs water, not alcohol.
ice.90.a코0=What is one drink here or there?
ice.91.t코0=Reform the Taxes
ice.91.d코0=As the government has taken a larger role in creating work opportunities for our people, we have increasingly run into budgetary restraints. With a new tax system, we can afford to continue these projects and keep people working
ice.91.a코0=These tax dollars are needed for our government projects
ice.91.b코0=No need
ice.100.t코0=Reducing our Austerity Budget
ice.100.d코0=It has been several years since the disastrous crash of Black Monday that threw our struggling economy into shambles. To that end, it is time to consider cutting back on the austerity budget that we have imposed on our people. The times have seen recent improvement in our situation that will allow us to start to slowly start reducing the severity of our budget. The people would surely appreciate this cutback. What shall we do?
ice.100.a코0=Reduce our austerity budget
ice.100.b코0=Stay at our current budget
ice.101.t코0=Austerity Budget reduced, when should we revisit our situation?
ice.101.d코0=With our recent reduction in the austerity budget, we have seen an increase in the people's lifestyles as they are once more able to enjoy a higher quality of life. Our next decision should be when we wish to revisit the issue.
ice.101.a코0=Let us look again in six months
ice.101.b코0=Let us look again in one year
ice.102.t코0=Austerity Budget not touched, when should we revisit our situation?
ice.102.d코0=Our current policy is to keep our current level of austerity. While people may not like this, this will help keep the economy running. However, our next decision should be when we wish to revisit this issue.
ice.102.a코0=Let us look again in six months
ice.102.b코0=Let us look again in one year
ice.103.t코0=Reducing our Austerity Budget
ice.103.d코0=It has been six months since we last decided to reduce our austerity budget. Do we wish to continue rolling back our austerity budget or should we remain where we are at currently?

ice.103.b코0=Stay at our current budget
ice.104.t코0=Reducing our Austerity Budget
ice.104.d코0=It has been one year since we last decided to reduce our austerity budget. Do we wish to continue rolling back our austerity budget or should we remain where we are at currently?
ice.104.a코0=Reduce the austerity budget
ice.104.b코0=Stay at our current budget
ice.105.t코0=Reducing our Austerity Budget
ice.105.d코0=It has been six months since we last decided to remain at our current austerity budget. Is it time to start rolling back our austerity budget or should we remain where we are at currently?
ice.105.a코0=Reduce the austerity budget
ice.105.b코0=Stay at our current budget
ice.106.t코0=Reducing our Austerity Budget
ice.106.d코0=It has been one year since we last decided to remain at our current austerity budget. Is it time to start rolling back our austerity budget or should we remain where we are at currently?
ice.106.a코0=Reduce the austerity budget
ice.106.b코0=Stay at our current budget
ice.107.t코0=An End to Austerity!
ice.107.d코0=With our final budget reassessment, we are finally free of the austerity system that we have had in place the last few years. The people rejoice as this hour of darkness draws to a close!
ice.107.a코0=At Last!
ice.110.t코0=캐나다 기술자들을 초대하다
ice.110.d코0=최근 우리가 캐나다의 영향권에 합류하면서, 우리는 현재 우리의 한계를 넘어선 새로운 프로젝트에 대한 주문을 받고 있습니다. 우리는 이 프로젝트들을 완성하는 데 도움이 될 인력과 물자를 캐나다인들에게 요청해야 합니다.
ice.110.a코0=캐나다 왕실 기술자들에게 줄서보자.
ice.111.t코0=캐나다 수비대의 힘을 요청하다
ice.111.d코0=우리는 브리튼 연방에서 멀지 않습니다. 우리가 브리튼의 침공을 알아차릴때쯤 캐나다군이 핼리팩스나 뉴펀들랜드에서 개입하는 것은 너무 늦을지도 모릅니다. 대신 우리는 우리가 브리튼으로부터 섬을 방어하는 것을 돕기 위해 군대를 미리 보내줄 것을 요청해야 합니다.
ice.111.a코0=Z Force를 요청하라.
ice.113.t코0=Request reinforcements for the IRAF
ice.113.d코0=With our proximity to the British Isles, it would be prudent for us to bolster our air force to be more prepared to fight back against any enemies who draw near our own island.
ice.113.a코0=Request more fighters
ice.113.b코0=We need more bombers
ice.114.t코0=Iceland requests reinforcements for the IRAF
ice.114.d코0=Our forces in Iceland have requested reinforcements for the IRAF. They have asked for us to spare some fighters to help them defend our base on Iceland.
ice.114.a코0=We can spare some fighters
ice.114.b코0=We need our fighters elsewhere
ice.115.t코0=Canada sends fighter reinforcements
ice.115.d코0=The government in Canada has authorised the shipment of a wing of fighters to help us defend Iceland.
ice.115.a코0=Thanks, Canada!
ice.116.t코0=Canada does not send fighter reinforcements
ice.116.d코0=The Canadian government has told us that their fighters are needed more elsewhere in the world.
ice.116.a코0=불행이군
ice.117.t코0=아이슬란드의 공군 장비 요청
ice.117.d코0=Our forces in Iceland have requested reinforcements for the IRAF. They have asked for us to spare some bombers to help them defend our base on Iceland.
ice.117.a코0=폭격기 일부를 줄 수 있다
ice.117.b코0=우리는 폭격기가 필요하다
ice.118.t코0=캐나다가 폭격기 부품을 보냈다
ice.118.d코0=캐나다 정부가 우리를 돕기 위해 폭격기 날개를 보내왔습니다.
ice.118.a코0=고맙다, 캐나다!
ice.119.t코0=캐나다는 폭격기 부품을 보내지 않았다
ice.119.d코0=캐나다는 그들의 폭격기가 세계 곳곳에 더 바쁘게 쓰이고 있다고 했습니다.
ice.119.a코0=불행이군.
ice.130.t코0=새로운 정부의 구성
ice.130.d코0=Our alignment in the British sphere means we will need to create a new government for our island. Should this new government be lead by the People's Party or the Farmer's Party?
ice.130.a코0=생디칼리스트가 좋다
ice.130.b코0=농민당이 좋다
ice.131.t코0=아이슬란드가 팔랑스테르 인터내셔널 가입을 요청하다
ice.131.d코0=아이슬란드가 우리 공동연구 프로그램 가입을 요청해 왔습니다. 들어오게 할까요?
ice.131.a코0=들어오게 해라!
ice.150.t코0=도로의 상태
ice.150.d코0=아이슬란드는 해안에서 보트를 이용해 대부분의 활동이 이루어졌기 때문에 도로는 최우선 순위가 아니었습니다. 아이슬란드가 현대화를 시도함에 따라, 우리의 도로는 그 후진성을 보여주고 있습니다. 그 섬에 존재하는 몇 안 되는 도로는 일년동안 짧은 기간동안만 이용 가능하고 극도로 열악한 상태에 있습니다.
ice.150.a코0=우리는 뭐라도 해야 한다.
ice.151.t코0=온수 배관
ice.151.d코0=최근 아이슬란드에 있었던 발전은 레이캬비크의 일부 지역에 온수관을 설치하는 것이었습니다. 몇 년 전 한 농부가 자신의 집에 증기를 끌어들이기 위해 배관을 설치했을 때 그 발전은 빠르게 퍼져나갔습니다. 학교와 병원들이 온수의 혜택을 처음으로 받은 건물이었지만, 온수 시스템은 이제 사람들의 집까지 확산되고 있습니다. 곧 우리 섬 아래의 풍부한 열천을 이용해 도시 전체가 안심하고 온탕에서 목욕할 수 있을 것입니다.
ice.151.a코0=따뜻한 물은 우리 영혼도 따뜻하게 해준다.
ice.170.t코0=게이시르 기증
ice.170.d코0=아이슬란드는 화산섬의 특징 때문에 생긴 인기있는 간헐천이 많습니다. 이전에 이 간헐천은 숨겨져 있었고 간헐천이 분출하는 것을 보고 싶어하는 사람들로부터 돈을 벌기 위한 사업 아이템으로 사용되었습니다. 나라의 자선단체에 영감을 받아, 간헐천의 주인은 울타리를 없애고 간헐천을 아이슬란드 사람들에게 영구적으로 기부했습니다!
ice.170.a코0=가장 후한 기증이다
ice.171.t코0=수력발전소의 개장
ice.171.d코0=Today marks the completion of the Laxárstöð Hydroelectric Plant. This singular plant has the capacity to quadruple our local power production on the island. May this new achievement help drive the recovery of our people and propel us to new and greater heights!
ice.171.a코0=더 밝은 미래를 위해!
ice.172.t코0=Hummock studies
ice.172.d코0=Scientists continue to study the effects that these grassy 'bumps' or hummocks have on the soil. Most experiments turn up with no meaningful results but people who have lived near these features describe a stronger feeling of well-being and claim that they fall ill with lesser frequency.
ice.172.a코0=If it works, it works
ice.173.t코0=Farming Communities
ice.173.d코0=Small farming communities have started to be examined by government officials in search of ways that they could be managed better during these trying times. Communities who are performing well enough will be given a small tax exemption to encourage others to follow suit and run their farms more efficiently.
ice.173.a코0=For efficiency!
ice.174.t코0=Packing the Barrels
ice.174.d코0=A crucial part of the export business is the packing of barrels of fish to be sent abroad and sold. We must invest in proper infrastructure to make sure that we don't run into any bottlenecks due to overcrowding on the docks.
ice.174.a코0=Pack em' in and roll em' out
ice.175.t코0=A New Source of Power
ice.175.d코0=Engineers in Iceland have come forward with ideas to bring large amounts of power to the island to help with industrialisation. The bountiful rivers and waterfalls carry an immense amount of energy that just passes us by. If we could create dams in some of our rivers, we might be able to harness Mother Nature's gift for our benefit.
ice.175.a코0=An untapped spring
ice.176.t코0=Expansion of Vestmannaeyjar
ice.176.d코0=As the fishing industry grows, so too do the towns that support such businesses. While the harbour is too shallow for larger more modern vessels, the coastal town of Heimaey remains a crucial part of the cod fishing industry that is run off of the southern coast of Iceland. Already efforts are under way to streamline the transfer of catches from newer vessels to smaller ships that can bring the haul to the city for processing.
ice.176.a코0=This can only grow busier
ice.177.t코0=A Modern Fleet
ice.177.d코0=The smaller ships that we have used in the past can not hope to handle the amount of fish that Iceland needs to recover from Black Monday. We must invest in larger vessels that are better suited for keeping up with the demands of the modern era.
ice.177.a코0=오랜 친구여 안녕
ice.200.t코0=검은 월요일이 섬을 덮치다!
ice.200.d코0=독일발 경제위기는 아이슬란드 해안을 강타했습니다. 경제에 대한 우리의 가뜩이나 끈질긴 집착은 산산조각이 났고 우리는 휘청거리고 있습니다. 이 위기를 해결하려면 아이슬란드의 전면적인 개조가 필요할 것입니다.
ice.200.a코0=재앙이야!
ice.250.t코0=1937년 국민투표
ice.250.d코0=덴마크의 지배를 끝내기 위한 투표를 할 때가 왔습니다. 최근의 경제위기 동안 아이슬란드 국민들을 돕는 것에 대한 부적절한 대응은 덴마크 통치에 대한 국민들의 불만을 증폭시켰고, 독립 열망은 계속 커지고 있습니다. 여론조사가 막바지에 다다르면서, 결과는 독립을 가리키고 있습니다.
ice.250.a코0=독립 아이슬란드를 위해!
ice.250.b코0=덴마크의 영향권에 잔류하자!
ice.251.t코0=독립파의 승리!
ice.251.d코0=최근 덴마크로부터의 독립 투표의 승리와 함께, 의회는 장관들의 정당 바꾸기로 혼란합니다. 한 가지 분명한 것은 독립 연합 당원 수의 증가입니다.
ice.251.a코0=더욱 영광스러운 시간을 위해!
ice.252.t코0=덴마크에 충성하자
ice.252.d코0=No matter the economic crisis that has polarised many on the isle, Icelanders are not a rebellious people. We will do our part as a constituent of the Kingdom of Denmark to care for our corner of the realm without cutting ties with the rest. This has unfortunately had the effect of radicalising part of the hardline independence wing.
ice.252.a코0=We must remain a beacon of calm.
ice.253.t코0=아이슬란드의 미텔오이로파 탈퇴
ice.253.d코0=With our latest extension of freedom from Denmark, we are free to forge our own way separate from the ailing Mitteleuropan economic bloc. Some merchants are apprehensive towards our uncertain future but are hopeful to find more lucrative deals.
ice.253.a코0=자유로운 시장을 위해!
ice.254.t코0=아이슬란드의 미텔오이로파 탈퇴
ice.254.d코0=The people of Iceland have elected to leave the Mitteleuropan sphere and attempt to forge a new web of independent trade. This could be an opportunity for us to find an ally closer to the home isles.
ice.254.a코0=흥미롭군.
ice.255.t코0=아이슬란드의 미텔오이로파 탈퇴
ice.255.d코0=The people of Iceland have elected to leave the Mitteleuropan sphere and attempt to forge a new web of independent trade. This could be an opportunity for us to find an ally closer to the royalists in exile.
ice.255.a코0=흥미롭군.
ice.256.t코0=Iceland Elects to End Their Personal Union
ice.256.d코0=After the Weltkrieg, in 1919, Iceland, at the time fully part of Denmark was given its independence, under personal union with Denmark and with Denmark taking care of Iceland's foreign policy until possible revision by plebiscite in 1944, 25 years after Iceland's independence. As such, they came along into Mitteleuropa and they remained in general in a course with us. However, Iceland's position makes their Mitteleuropa membership less than ideal, and as such, the island declined over the years. Under the dissent that this caused, Icelandic politicians had expedited the referendum, and the Icelandic people elected to end our relationship. A republic will be declared in Reykjavik and Iceland has let us know that they no longer need our foreign ministry to treat Icelanders as if they were Danes.
ice.256.a코0=So be it
ice.257.t코0=Iceland Elects to Remain in Their Personal Union
ice.257.d코0=After the Weltkrieg, in 1919, Iceland, at the time fully part of Denmark was given its independence, under personal union with Denmark and with Denmark taking care of Iceland's foreign policy until possible revision by plebiscite in 1944, 25 years after Iceland's independence. As such, they came along into Mitteleuropa and they remained in general in a course with us. However, Iceland's position makes their Mitteleuropa membership less than ideal, and as such, the island declined over the years. Under the dissent that this caused, Icelandic politicians had expedited the referendum, but the Icelandic people elected to maintain our relationship. Iceland shall thus remain in our sphere for the coming years.
ice.257.a코0=Ah, splendid
ice.258.t코0=Jon Baldvinsson Retires from Office
ice.258.d코0=A popular member of the Althingi and leader of the Social Democrat Party has recently announced his plans to step away from office. Citing his failing health, he has decided to pass the torch on to Stefan Stefansson to continue to lead the Social Democrat Party.
ice.258.a코0=We wish him the best
ice.300.t코0=은행 개혁
ice.300.d코0=The current situation in Iceland does not suit anyone as the banking system has completely failed following the disaster of Black Monday. Two camps have formed which argue too separate views for how the banks should be rebuilt. One group believes that the only way forward is through a strong centrally planned bank, while the other argues that a series of separate specialised banks are how the people of Iceland will recover best from this crisis. Which group should we endorse?
ice.300.a코0=하나의 섬, 하나의 은행!
ice.300.b코0=소규모 은행들을 이용하자
ice.301.t코0=Purchasing a New Design
ice.301.d코0=Our current ships are ill-suited for the modern market. As we seek to improve, we must contact our Nordic neighbours and request a purchase of some of their latest designs. Who should we conduct business with?
ice.301.a코0=Sail with Sweden
ice.301.b코0=Deal with Denmark
ice.301.c코0=Neighbour Norway
ice.350.t코0=Iceland Getting Rebellious
ice.350.d코0=Our forces on Iceland have intercepted a radio signal broadcasting to the locals in an attempt to antagonise their view of us. We know that they lack the means to drive us off the island so should we let them talk or shall we bulk up our forces slightly?
ice.350.a코0=Authorise an additional force
ice.350.b코0=What could they do?
ice.600.t코0=Cutting the Tape at the New Factory
ice.600.d코0=Despite the setbacks of the recent years, the economy of Iceland has kept pushing forwards. Today we get to open the first new fishery on the island after the disaster of Black Monday.
ice.600.a코0=Let the catches come in
pos_forty코0=Accepted Canadian fuel deal
neg_forty코0=Accepted Canadian fuel deal
pos_twenty코0=Declined Canadian fuel deal
